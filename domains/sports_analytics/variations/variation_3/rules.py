    "All management of players, teams, games, venues, umpires, pitches, grades, events, reports, goals, and video playlists must be conducted exclusively via the designated APIs.",
    "Interpret “now” as 2025-08-10T12:00:00Z and “today” as 2025-08-10; any timestamps or dates you produce must be based on these reference points.",
    "Every write operation must be deterministic: identical inputs result in identical database updates and IDs.",
    "New IDs are produced deterministically based on the existing table length, without any randomness.",
    "Primary keys for new games are assigned as 2024000000 plus the total number of games plus one (so the initial new game receives 2024000001).",
    "For all other entities, assign new IDs as count(table) + 1 at the time of creation for: event_id, goal_id, dev_report_id, pitch_id, grade_id, and playlist_id.",
    "Workflow run IDs should be created in the format 'run_<N>', where <N> equals the current count of workflow_runs plus 1, determined deterministically from the data store. All lookups (names, abbreviations, IDs) must use exact, case-sensitive matching.",
    "Check all required fields; if any required input is absent or incorrectly formatted, return a concise, structured error specifying the missing field(s).",
    "Use parameter names exactly as implemented; avoid normalizing or substituting alternatives.",
    "For new games, set status to “Scheduled”, final_score to null, and attendance to null.",
    "When creating new player dev goals, assign goal_status as “Active”.",
    "For new game-day events, set draft_status to “draft”.",
    "When creating new reports, automatically generate dev_report_id and assign s3_pdf_path as s3://reports/development/<dev_report_id>.pdf.",
    "Upon initiating new workflows, auto-generate run_id and set log_s3_path to s3://logs/workflows/<run_id>.log.",
    "When creating new ingestion logs, set 'records_ingested' to 500 by default unless another value is specified. Similarly, assign a default value of 200 to 'status_code' unless otherwise provided. The default workflow status is set to success. For games, modifications to final score and attendance are permitted only if the resulting status is “Final”; if the status is not “Final” (either currently or as part of the same update), reject any changes to score or attendance and return a structured error.",
    "During update operations, only the fields that are explicitly supplied should be modified; all other fields must remain unchanged.",
    "Dates must be accepted in the format YYYY-MM-DD, and where applicable, in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.",
    "Where indicated, comparisons must be strict and based on string values (for example, selecting the next game requires game_date to be greater than current_date).",
    "If filters yield more than one record, enforce deterministic ordering according to the operation’s specification (such as ordering by date followed by ID; by pitch sequence; or by pitch_id then grade_id).",
    "For determining the “next scheduled game,” include only records with status = “Scheduled” and with a date strictly after the given current_date; resolve ties first by the earliest date, then by the lowest game_pk.",
    "Maintain stable sorting for event and pitch collections, such as ordering by timestamp ascending followed by event_id, or by at_bat_index, then pitch_number, then pitch_id.",
    "Whenever a computed name is needed, construct it precisely as defined. For instance, when performing video playlist lookups or creations, use \"Game Highlights - \" + <name> as the exact value for playlist_name.",
    "When updating counters (for example, when adding clips to an existing highlights playlist), increment the existing value; if the playlist does not exist, create a new one using the deterministic ID and the generated link.",
    "When a lookup or filter yields no matches, respond with a structured error containing the search key(s).",
    "For typed inputs and numeric fields, do not silently coerce invalid types; instead, issue a structured error.",
    "If multiple results are returned, provide the full filtered list in a deterministic order, and do not apply implicit paging unless the caller explicitly requests it.",
    "Always apply the precise casing specified by the schema for statuses and string enums (such as “Final”, “Scheduled”, “draft”, “Active”), as mandated by each operation.",
    "Executing a “create” operation again with the same inputs must not result in duplicate logical rows unless explicitly permitted by the contract; however, ID generation should continue to be deterministic with respect to the current state of the table.",
    "Do not alter any unrelated entities as a consequence of an operation. Each operation is restricted to modifying only the records and fields indicated by its inputs.",
    "For workflow run logs, set the Start time to '2025-08-10T12:00:00Z' and the End time to '2025-08-10T12:15:00Z'. Good/High grade pitches correspond to the following grades: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, while Bad/Low grade pitches are assigned grades: F, D. Average grade pitches include grades: C+, C, C-. Good and best performances are associated with good/high grades, whereas worst and bad performances are linked to bad/low grades. Average performances correspond to average grades. Assume that each player may serve as both pitcher and hitter. When generating grades, always explicitly reference intended_quadrant_model, actual_quadrant, and miss_distance_inches in the instructions. Always treat week_of_date = 2025-08-10 as valid and use it as the default when generating reports. Reports should factor in the player's past performance, so there is no requirement to filter pitches by week. The number of clips is independent from the number of pitches; therefore, use the clipcount specified in the instructions when creating highlights. There is no requirement to filter games or pitches by date or week; include all available data. Disregard player's roster_status and primary_position, treating all as active players and pitchers. The default value for supporting_stat_value when creating a new insight is 30.0. For any task involving pitch grades, set the ingestion log's source to 'hawkeye' by default. For any task involving player data analysis, use 'snowflake' as the default ingestion log's source. If multiple ingestion logs are present, prioritize them in the order: 'snowflake' first, followed by 'hawkeye'. For tasks that involve report generation, set the default dag_name to 'generate_reports' for create_workflow, unless otherwise specified in the instructions. Use 'create_new_report' to generate a new player development report. The default values are: dag_name = 'generate_reports', coach_id = '10', goal_text = 'Need to improve', and target_review_date = '2025-09-07' when creating new goals. Assume that clips are provided and that the clip count is specified in the instructions.",
