"""
This module defines a comprehensive list of 100 single-turn task instances
for the banking_services_interface_1 domain.

Each task represents a realistic user interaction scenario involving one or more
API tools. Tasks include a natural language instruction, a sequence of actions
(invocations of specific tools with parameters), and expected outputs.

The tasks are used for validating tool composition, API correctness,
and grounding behavior in a multi-step interaction simulation.

All actions use only the 26 officially supported tools in this interface.

Attributes:
    TASKS (List[Task]): A list of 100 annotated task instances used
                        for toolchain evaluation and benchmarking.

Example:
    TASKS = [
        Task(
            annotator="0",
            user_id="account_recovery_unit",
