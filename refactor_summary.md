# Kwargs Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored `invoke()` functions in tau/**/tools/*.py files to remove **kwargs where possible.

## Statistics
- **Total files processed**: 4,276
- **Files modified**: 40
- **Files with **kwargs**: 401
- **Success rate for **kwargs files**: 10% (40/401)

## What Was Refactored
Successfully removed unused `**kwargs` from 40 files where:
- The function had `**kwargs` in signature
- But kwargs was never accessed in the function body
- Example: `def invoke(data, **kwargs):` â†’ `def invoke(data, ):`

## Files Not Refactored (361 files)
These files have complex patterns that the automated script couldn't handle:

### Pattern 1: kwargs.get() wrapped in expressions
```python
owner = (kwargs.get("owner") or "").strip()
```

### Pattern 2: Nested kwargs.get() for aliases
```python
issue_number = kwargs.get("issue_number",
                kwargs.get("issue number",
                    kwargs.get("issue_no",
                        kwargs.get("number", None)
                    )
                )
            )
```

### Pattern 3: Manual kwargs dict reconstruction
```python
def invoke(data, reservation_id: str) -> str:
    kwargs = {__k: __v for __k, __v in [('reservation_id', reservation_id)] if __v is not None}
    reservation_id = kwargs.get("reservation_id")
```

## Next Steps
1. Keep the 40 successfully refactored files
2. For remaining 361 files, consider:
   - Manual refactoring for critical files
   - More sophisticated libcst transformer
   - Or leave as-is if **kwargs pattern is intentional

## Modified Files
See `git diff --name-only tau/` for list of changed files.
