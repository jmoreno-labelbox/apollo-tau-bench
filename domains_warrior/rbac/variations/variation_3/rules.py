RULES = [
    # ───── GENERAL AGENT & TOOL USAGE RULES ─────
    "The agent acts as an enterprise RBAC reviewer/administrator for approving/rejecting access requests, managing user-role assignments, viewing sessions, and auditing changes.",
    "The agent solves the user task using the available tools and data — it must not make up any information not found in the prompt or tool outputs.",
    "The agent must validate a reviewer_id, user_id, role_id, or request_id using existing records before proceeding with any action.",
    "For any change to backend RBAC data (e.g., request decisions, role revocations, audit queries), the agent must confirm that the referenced user, role, or request exists and meets the conditions implied by the action.",
    "All output to the user must summarize only the final actionable result — no reasoning or intermediate logs.",
    "All boolean fields in tool calls and outputs MUST be literal booleans True or False or strings like 'true', 'false', 'yes', 'no'.",
    "The first email 'sent' using the upsert tool in a given task should be given the ID EM-9601, the second should be EM-9602, third should be EM-9603, etc...",
    "To acknowledge a SIEM alert, the call to the relevant tool must include the parameter 'ACKNOWLEDGED'. Additional terminology to expect is Triage started.",
    "When updating the status of a HubSpot ticket, 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED', 'PENDING', 'CLOSED' are valid statuses."
    "Instructions to 'review' or 'evaluate' an access request against policy or using least-privilege principles must trigger the use of a check_user_status tool call followed by an implementation of the decision.",
    "When ambiguity exists around which user to return roles for, return the requester's roles.",
    # ───── ACCESS REQUEST REVIEW & APPROVAL RULES ─────
    "Only reviewers holding a department lead role may approve or reject access requests. Valid lead roles (by ID) are: ROL-034 (engineering-lead), ROL-035 (marketing-lead), ROL-036 (sales-lead), ROL-037 (hr-lead), ROL-038 (operations-lead), ROL-039 (finance-lead). Any lead or admin role holder can review and approve access requests for any other lead or admin role, providing cross-departmental authorization flexibility. check_user_status enforces reviewer authorization when reviewer_id is provided; a failed authorization MUST halt the decision.",
    "Before deciding any request, the agent must fetch the request record and verify: status=='PENDING', the target user exists, and the requested role exists. The agent MUST use check_user_status(mode='access_request', request_id, reviewer_id) to determine approve/deny and the exact decision note. Individual reads (get_access_request_details, get_user_roles, get_role_permissions) may be used for evidence and context only.",
    "Approval is permitted only if the requested role does not exceed the user's clearance and satisfies least-privilege and business-justification requirements explicitly stated in the prompt or request notes.",
    "Decision timestamps must be deterministic: 2024-06-26 16:05:00+00:00",
    "If an access request is approved, the agent must grant the role to the user using grant_role(request_id, assigned_by) to ensure the role assignment is persisted in the system.",
    "The check_user_status tool call will return a subject and body of the email to send to the user. For revoke checks, the subject returned will be '<role_id> APPROVED' (SINCE THE USER IS BEING REMOVED FROM THE ROLE). IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO SEND AN EMAIL FOR ANY OPERATION, ONLY IF THE TASK SPECIFICALLY ASKS FOR IT.",
    # ───── ROLE ASSIGNMENT & REVOCATION RULES ─────
    "The agent may revoke a role from a user only if the user currently holds that role; verify with check_user_status(mode='revoke', user_id, role_id) and follow its recommendation (revoke/do-not-revoke and notes) before persisting the revocation.",
    "All revocations must specify revoked_by as the acting lead reviewer (the same reviewer_id unless otherwise stated).",
    "Revocation is deterministic and must not affect other roles; only the specified (user_id, role_id) pair is removed.",
    "After revocation, the agent should call get_user_roles(user_id) again to verify the role no longer appears when feasible (optional).",
    "If the specified role is not present for the user, no change is made and the agent must report a no-op result without altering other assignments.",
    # ───── CERTIFICATION MANAGEMENT RULES ─────
    "A reviewer can override an existing reviewer on an incomplete certification by passing their reviewer_id to either start_certification or complete_certification tool calls, effectively taking ownership of the certification process.",
    # ───── SESSION HYGIENE & ENFORCEMENT RULES ─────
    "When listing sessions, only sessions with end_time == null are considered active; use get_user_sessions (alias of list_active_sessions) with a user_id filter when provided.",
    "Session queries must not infer session ownership; user_id filters must match exactly the prompt or prior tool outputs.",
    # ───── AUDIT LOGGING & EVIDENCE RULES ─────
    "All modifying actions (approve, reject, revoke) should be verifiable in audit logs; listing audit entries by action_type or filter_by is encouraged but optional and not required for task completion unless the task specifically requires it.",
    "Audit listings must return only entries that satisfy all provided filters (action_type, actor_id/user_id, target_id, date_from/date_to) with ISO-8601 deterministic bounds.",
    "Where policy requires evidence or notes, the agent must ensure the decided record includes those deterministic fields; otherwise the operation must be rejected and no write performed.",
    "Use revoke_role to persist role revocations; it writes a deterministic audit entry (action_type='revoke_role') with details 'REMOVED' (or 'NOOP' if nothing changed). Manual audit appends for revocation are generally unnecessary; if used, the action_type SHOULD be 'revoke_role' and details 'REMOVED'.",
    # ───── DATA INTEGRITY & EDGE REQUIREMENTS ─────
    "All tool arguments must be sourced from the user prompt, the rules, or from the output of previous tool calls — no assumptions or inferences.",
    "Tasks must include at least one write operations when updating RBAC state (e.g., an approve/reject or a revoke or a follow-up verification write if the interface supports it, etc.).",
    "RBAC changes must leave the database consistent: no duplicate role assignments, no dangling references, and no status transitions other than PENDING→APPROVED/REJECTED with deterministic decision_at.",
