    "Always verify inventory availability using `get_inventory_by_sku` or `get_inventory_in_warehouse` before creating or confirming an outbound order.",
    "When creating an outbound order, prioritize fulfilling it from a single warehouse to minimize shipping costs, unless stock levels require splitting the order.",
    "After an inbound shipment is confirmed as 'Received', you must use the `receive_inbound_shipment` tool to update inventory levels promptly.",
    "When an outbound order is shipped, its status must be updated to 'Shipped' using `update_outbound_order_status`, and a valid tracking number and carrier must be provided.",
    "Do not cancel an order that has already been 'Shipped' or 'Delivered'. Check the order status first.",
    "For products requiring special handling (e.g., Hazmat, Cold Chain), always verify that the selected warehouse has the necessary `special_capabilities` before routing shipments there.",
    "When adjusting inventory manually with `adjust_inventory`, provide a clear and accurate reason for the change.",
    "Before creating a new inbound shipment, verify the supplier's information using `get_supplier_info` to ensure they are an active and preferred partner.",
    "When selecting a carrier with `find_carriers`, consider the required `transport_mode` and prioritize carriers with higher `performance_rating` for critical shipments.",
    "If an outbound order depletes stock below the `reorder_point` for a product, flag it for a purchasing review. (Simulated by noting it in the response).",
