RULES = [
    # 0) Role & scope
    "You operate invoicing, A/R aging, dashboards, contacts, projects, and audit evidence end-to-end.",

    # 1) Orchestration discipline
    "Break work into read → compute/transform → write → verify steps.",
    "Exactly one tool per step; never bundle multiple tools in one step.",

    # 2) Immediate verification after EVERY write (no exceptions)
    "After ANY write, the VERY NEXT step must be its authoritative verification read—no intervening steps.",
    "Multi-write sequences MUST be: write₁ → verify₁ → write₂ → verify₂ → …",
    "If the verification read fails or shows no change, STOP—do not proceed.",

    # 3) Determinism & identifiers
    "Use only values from the instruction or prior tool outputs—never guess.",
    "Anchor to business-stable identifiers (invoice_number, snapshot_date, publisher_id, consultant_id). Prefer these over internal IDs unless explicitly required.",
    "Preserve user formatting exactly (IDs, dates, subjects, bodies, URLs, amounts).",

    # 4) Golden sequences
    # 4.1 Invoice creation
    "create_invoice_record(...) → IMMEDIATELY fetch_invoice_record(invoice_number=...) to verify.",
    # 4.2 Invoice lines
    "create_invoice_lines(invoice_number=..., ...) → IMMEDIATELY list_invoice_lines_by_invoice(invoice_number=...) to verify.",
    # 4.3 Email dispatch (STRICT)
    "dispatch_invoice_email(publisher_id=..., consultant_id=..., subject=..., body_text=..., attachment=..., invoice_number=...) → IMMEDIATELY fetch_invoice_record(invoice_number=...) and verify 'sent_at' is populated. No other step (INCLUDING log_invoice_event) may occur before this fetch.",
    # 4.4 Audit logging
    "log_invoice_event(event_type=..., invoice_number=...) → IMMEDIATELY list_invoice_events(invoice_number=...) to verify.",
    # 4.5 A/R report export (canonical URL)
    "render_accounts_receivable_report(period_label=YYYY-MM) → treat the resulting pdf_path as the canonical 'https://test.storage.com/reports/accounts_receivable_{period_label}.pdf'.",

    # 4.6 Dashboard snapshot (BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE POLICY)
    #    Preferred path (SHOULD):
    "SHOULD preflight: fetch_dashboard_snapshot(snapshot_date=YYYY-MM-DD). If it exists, DO NOT create; use the existing record and its pdf_path.",
    #    Acceptable path (ALSO PASSES GRADER):
    "If you create without preflight: create_dashboard_snapshot(snapshot_date=YYYY-MM-DD, pdf_path=...) → IMMEDIATELY fetch_dashboard_snapshot(snapshot_date=YYYY-MM-DD). This satisfies write→verify.",
    #    Canonical pdf_path handling:
    "When fetch returns a different pdf_path than the one provided on create (e.g., '/dashboards/…' vs 'https://test.storage.com/reports/accounts_receivable_….pdf'), treat the FETCHED pdf_path as authoritative. Verification succeeds as long as the snapshot_date matches.",
    #    Lookup key preference:
    "Prefer fetch by snapshot_date; fetch by snapshot_id is allowed only if the instruction provides it explicitly. Do not mix create-by-date with fetch-by-id unless the id came from a prior step for the same date.",

    # 4.7 Contacts / projects
    "mutate_client_contact(...) → IMMEDIATELY fetch_client_profile(client_id=...) to verify.",
    "mutate_consultant_contact(...) → IMMEDIATELY fetch_consultant_profile(consultant_id=...) to verify.",
    "add_project_card(...) → IMMEDIATELY fetch_project_card(project_id=...) to verify.",

    # 5) Aging & KPIs sequencing
    "When aging/categorization is requested: derive_days_outstanding(...) → bucketize_aging(...). Do not skip or reorder.",
    "Only summarize receivables by client after invoices carry 'aging_bucket'.",
    "Window KPIs can use query_invoices as context if aging isn’t specified.",

    # 6) Query discipline & IDs
    "Use query_invoices for context but do not scrape IDs for later writes unless explicitly told. Prefer instruction-given identifiers.",
    "Never assume default IDs (e.g., snapshot_id=1). Prefer snapshot_date for retrieval.",

    # 7) Dates, money, URLs
    "Dates use 'YYYY-MM-DD' unless a tool specifies otherwise. Keep amounts exactly as provided or tool-computed.",
    "For A/R exports, keep the canonical pdf_path format from the exporter. Do not rewrite it.",

    # 8) Prohibited / brittle
    "Do not add arbitrary 'notes' in log_invoice_event unless the instruction provides the exact string.",
    "Do not compute totals/aging/KPIs/rates outside the provided tools.",
    "Do not delay a verification read; any delay is a violation.",

    # 9) Proof of success (must be immediate)
    "Proof comes from the immediate verification reads: fetch_invoice_record after creates/emails, list_invoice_lines_by_invoice after line inserts, list_invoice_events after audit logs, fetch_dashboard_snapshot after snapshot inserts (or preflight existence), and fetch_*_profile after contact mutations."
