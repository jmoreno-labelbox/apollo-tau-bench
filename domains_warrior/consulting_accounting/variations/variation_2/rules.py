    # GENERAL ENTITY RESOLUTION
    "Always resolve IDs (e.g., consultant_id, publisher_id, project_id, invoice_id, expense_id) by querying the database using provided search parameters before using them in any write operation.",
    "If the required entity is not found, return a 'not found' response and make no database changes.",
    "When creating new records, use provided IDs exactly as specified to ensure deterministic behavior.",
    "Only perform actions that are directly required by the task objectives - avoid unnecessary data retrieval unless needed for subsequent operations.",
    "Focus on business outcomes and policy compliance rather than following rigid procedural steps.",

    # PROJECT & PUBLISHER VALIDATION
    "Only work with active projects (is_active = true) unless explicitly instructed to include inactive projects.",

    "Apply category-specific deductibility rules from expense_categories.json when calculating allowed_amount.",

    # CASH FLOW & COLLECTIONS

    "Calculate aging buckets accurately based on current_date minus invoice_date: Current (0-30 days), 31-60 days, 61-90 days, and 90+ days past due.",
    "Aging calculation must properly compute days_overdue = (current_date - invoice_date) for unpaid invoices, not return 0 for all invoices.",
    "Flag invoices as high-risk when: payment behavior shows >60% late payment frequency, or amount exceeds $2000 CAD and client has poor payment consistency.",
    "Generate collection actions based on aging: 0-30 days = friendly reminder, 31-60 days = formal notice, 61-90 days = phone call required, 90+ days = escalation procedures.",

    "Use current year tax rates from tax_rates.json for calculating tax reserves and obligations.",

    "Document retention requires PDF copies of all invoices and scanned receipts for minimum 7 years per CRA requirements.",

    # DETERMINISM & DATA INTEGRITY
    "All write operations must be deterministic - use fixed IDs, dates, and timestamps provided in input parameters.",
