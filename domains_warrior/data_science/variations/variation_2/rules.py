    "Protocol Name: City Status Compilation Protocol",
    "When the user requests a city status compilation, the agent must apply this protocol.",
    "The protocol defines: (a) resolving location via project_config+geocoding, "
    "(b) retrieving the primary NOAA station only, (c) summarizing processed_timeseries, "
    "(d) retrieving predictions and metrics, (e) appending a deterministic terminal_log entry.",
    "The log entry must include command='status_compilation_<city_slug>', exit_code=0, "
    "printed_message='<command> completed', and printed_ts sourced deterministically from the database.",
    "stdout and stderr must be empty unless read verbatim from existing tables.",
    "Outputs must be strictly structured data (no narratives), including city, primary_station_id, "
    "processed_timeseries summary, predictions summary, metrics summary, and terminal_log confirmation.",
    "Protocol Override: City Status Compilation Protocol may be overridden per task by explicitly stated, deterministic conditions.",
    "Override: Station selection may specify a condition on tide_predictions.method; if the condition is met, use station A; otherwise use station B. The decision must be resolved via database reads (no guesses).",
    "Protocol Name: Model Variant Selection Protocol",
    "When a user requests selecting the best model variant for a city, apply this protocol.",
    "Selection criteria (default): choose the model with the highest AUC; if AUC ties, choose the one with higher Accuracy; if still tied, choose the one with the most recent metrics.generated_ts.",
    "The protocol must resolve candidates via deterministic reads from metrics and predictions tables; no values may be invented.",
    "After selecting a single winner, append one deterministic terminal log entry with: command='model_selection_<city_slug>', exit_code=0, printed_message='<command> completed', printed_ts taken from the winner's metrics.generated_ts; stdout='' and stderr=''.",
    "Outputs returned to user must be strictly data-bearing and limited to fields explicitly requested in the instruction.",
    "Protocol Override: tasks may override the tie-breaker by specifying a maximum AUC difference threshold under which recency (metrics.generated_ts) becomes the primary tie-breaker.",
    "Protocol Name: Primary Station Determination Protocol",
    "When a user requests determining the primary NOAA station for a city and compiling a compact run summary, apply this protocol.",
    "Default selection: choose the station marked 'primary' among candidates returned by station search; if not present, use the first station in deterministic ordering.",

    "Outputs to the user must be strictly the fields explicitly requested in the instruction (no narratives).",
    "Protocol Override: tasks may override the primary-station rule by specifying a datum-based condition on recent water levels. Example: if water_levels.datum for a candidate station equals a specific datum value, force selection of that station; otherwise follow the default selection. The decision must be resolved via database reads only."
    "Protocol Override: When the target city has no dataset_split timestamp, derive the terminal log printed_ts from processed_timeseries.created_ts for that city's dataset.",
    "Protocol Override: A task may constrain the candidate set by requiring validation of a specific station's tide predictions over a fixed window before final primary selection.",
    "Protocol Name: City Risk Snapshot Protocol",
    "When a user requests a risk snapshot for a city, the agent must: (a) resolve nearby NOAA stations deterministically, (b) choose exactly one primary station, (c) summarize core artifacts (processed dataset, model predictions, and metrics) for the city, and (d) append a deterministic terminal log entry.",
    "Primary-station default: prefer the station explicitly marked 'primary' in station search results; if none is marked, select the first station_id in deterministic ordering.",
    "The snapshot must read predictions and metrics from the chosen model variant named in the task or policy; no values may be invented.",
    "When using get_stations_by_location, always supply the radius_km from project_config for the city. "
    "This ensures the parameter is deterministic and never invented."
    "Terminal log entry must include: command='risk_snapshot_<city_slug>', exit_code=0, printed_message='<command> completed', printed_ts sourced deterministically (e.g., from a known run timestamp for the model or from a city-specific artifact timestamp). stdout='' and stderr=''.",
    "Outputs returned to the user must be strictly the fields requested by the instruction (no narratives).",
    "Protocol Override: tasks may override the station-selection rule using a datum-based condition on recent water levels for a specific candidate station, evaluated on a fixed time window read from the database; if the condition holds, force that station as primary; otherwise fall back to the default selection.",
    "Protocol Name: Multi-City Comparative Snapshot Protocol",
    "When a user requests a comparative risk snapshot across two cities, the agent must: "
    "(a) resolve candidate stations for each city using get_stations_by_location with radius_km from project_config, "
    "(b) validate one deterministic station-specific condition per city (e.g., tide prediction method or water-level datum) in fixed time windows read from the database, "

    "Protocol Name: Datum-and-Method Station Confirmation Protocol",
    "When a user requests a station confirmation snapshot for a city, the agent must: "
    "(a) resolve candidate stations using get_stations_by_location with radius_km from project_config, "
    "(b) validate, for a specific candidate station, that water_levels.datum equals the requested datum over the given window via get_water_levels_window, "
    "(c) validate, for the same station, that tide_predictions.method equals the requested method over the given window via get_tide_predictions_window, "
    "(d) summarize the processed dataset via get_processed_timeseries_summary from the explicit CSV path provided in the task instruction, "
    "(e) retrieve metrics and predictions for the named model variant, and "

    "Protocol Name: Cross-City AUC-Gap Promotion Protocol",
    "When a user requests a comparative promotion decision between two cities, the agent must: "
    "(a) resolve candidate stations per city using get_stations_by_location with radius_km from project_config, "
    "(b) validate a city-specific station condition for each city using fixed windows (e.g., SF tide_predictions.method, MIA water_levels.datum), "
    "(c) read the processed dataset summary for the final chosen city from a CSV path explicitly provided in the instruction, "
    "(d) retrieve metrics (and predictions if requested) for each named model variant, "
    "(e) choose a single winner by the rule: if the absolute AUC gap â‰¥ threshold, choose the higher AUC; else, among cities whose validated station condition passes, choose the one with more recent metrics.generated_ts, "
    "(f) append a deterministic terminal log entry with command='ccap_promotion_<cityA_slug>-<cityB_slug>', exit_code=0, printed_message='<command> completed', printed_ts explicitly provided by the task; stdout='' and stderr=''.",
    "Outputs must include exactly and only the fields requested in the task instruction.",
    "Protocol Override: the AUC-gap threshold is task-specific and must be provided explicitly in the instruction; station conditions must be resolved strictly via database reads."
    "Protocol Name: Full Data Ingestion Protocol",
    "When the user requests a full ingestion of a new city dataset, the agent must apply this protocol.",
    "The protocol defines: (a) registering raw files into file_directory and file_store, "
    "(b) recording geocoding and weather forecasts for the city, "
    "(c) registering ETL run and processed dataset, "
    "(d) generating features, "
    "(e) saving model configuration, dataset split, model record, predictions, and metrics, "
    "(f) publishing stakeholder outputs deterministically.",
    "All outputs (timestamps, file paths, metrics) must be sourced deterministically from the database or explicitly provided in the task instruction; no invented values are allowed.",
    "Outputs returned to the user must be exactly those requested in the instruction.",
    "Protocol Override: tasks may override one or more parameters of ingestion, such as forcing a specific random_seed, a fixed feature file path, or a custom model variant name. Overrides must be resolved deterministically from the instruction."

    "Every execution of this protocol must conclude with at least one deterministic write operation "
    "(e.g., appending a terminal log entry confirming the audit, or publishing stakeholder outputs). "
    "Protocol Override: tasks may override the protocol in ways that change the action sequence. Examples:",
    "- Override: Require validation of a specific training command in the terminal_log â†’ adds an action get_terminal_log_command_result with the explicit command.",
    "- Override: Restrict MCP tool call retrieval to a given server (e.g., weather-api) â†’ changes parameters of get_mcp_tool_calls_by_server to filter only that server.",
