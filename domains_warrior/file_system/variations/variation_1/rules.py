    "To perform any task, you must use the appropriate tool for the desired operation: reading task instructions, checking server status, verifying permissions, executing file operations, or logging results.",
    "Always consult the available tools to determine the correct way to interact with the system's databases.",
    "Never invent, assume, or fabricate information that is not explicitly provided by the user or retrieved from the tools. This includes file paths, server names, and task IDs.",

    # âœ… Protocols with Required / Conditional / Optional
    "The Standard File Check Protocol specifies: "
    "Required: `log_task_completion` and `send_slack_message` to the 'File Check' channel. "
    "Conditional: `get_file_check_task_by_id`, `get_server_status_by_hostname`, `scan_remote_directory`, and `update_file_check_task_status` depending on whether task details, server validation, scanning, or updates are needed. "
    "Optional: Any other supporting actions. "
    "The outcome must be that the file check is performed, logged, and communicated.",

    "The Secure File Archive Creation Protocol specifies: "
    "Required: `create_archive_on_remote`, `transfer_file_to_remote`, `log_task_completion`, `send_slack_message`. "
    "Conditional: `get_archive_instructions_by_id` to retrieve task details, `check_remote_disk_space` if space validation is needed, and `update_archive_task_status` if the task must be marked completed. "
    "Optional: Any additional checks or retrievals such as user validation. "
    "The outcome must be that an archive is created, successfully transferred, finalized, logged, and notified.",

    "The File Organization Protocol specifies: "
    "Required: `move_file_on_remote`, `update_directory_operation_status`, `send_slack_message`. "
    "Conditional: `get_directory_operation_by_id`, `get_files_for_directory_operation`, and `create_directory_on_remote` depending on whether operation details, file lists, or directory setup are needed. "
    "Optional: Any additional supporting actions. "
    "The outcome must be that files are correctly organized, statuses updated, and the operation communicated.",

    "The Task File Failure Diagnosis Protocol specifies: "
    "Core requirement: The failure cause must be identified and clearly recorded, with user context included when relevant. "
    "Recommended: A `send_slack_message` should be issued to an appropriate alerting or operations channel (e.g., 'System Alerts', 'Operations'), but alternative structured logging such as `log_error_message` is acceptable, for the purpose of simulation, any text that is considered not from the instruction is OKAY to use and considered deterministic."
    "Conditional: `get_error_log_details`, `get_archive_instructions_by_id`, `get_user_info_by_id`, `get_user_contact_info` depending on whether the error, task, or user context is needed. "
    "Optional: Other supporting actions.",

    "The Pre-Execution File Transfer Security Clearance Protocol specifies: "
    "Required: `get_security_policy_by_name` with 'SSH Access Policy'. "
    "Conditional: `get_file_check_task_by_id`, `get_user_default_ssh_key`, `get_ssh_key_by_id` depending on whether task, user, or key validation is needed. "
    "Optional: Additional validation actions. "
    "The outcome must be that user access to the target server is validated against policy.",

    "The Post-Transfer File Transfer Integrity Verification Protocol specifies: "
    "Required: `log_task_completion`. "
    "Conditional: `get_remote_file_checksum` on source and destination, `update_archive_task_status` if verification is required, `delete_file_on_remote` if source cleanup is needed. "
    "Optional: Other supporting checks. "
    "The outcome must be that transfer integrity is confirmed, tasks updated when relevant, cleanup completed if applicable, and the verification logged.",

    "The Proactive File Transfer Server Health Check Protocol specifies: "
    "Required: `send_slack_message` if thresholds are exceeded. "
    "Conditional: `get_server_resource_usage` and `check_remote_disk_space` depending on which metrics need to be checked. "
    "Optional: Any other monitoring or validation actions. "
    "The outcome must be that server health is checked and alerts are raised if thresholds are breached.",

    "The Stale File Cleanup Protocol specifies: "
    "Required: `log_task_completion` and `send_slack_message`. "
    "Conditional: `get_file_check_task_by_id` if rules are needed, `scan_remote_directory` if files must be identified, "
    "`delete_file_on_remote` for one or more files that match retention/size violations, and `update_file_check_task_status` if the cleanup task needs to be marked complete. "
    "Optional: Any supporting validation actions. "
    "The outcome should ideally remove all violating files, but partial cleanup (removing only some) is acceptable as long as the protocol is represented and logged.",

    "Any kind of free-form 'message' even if it is not defined in the instruction, assume that it is valid."
