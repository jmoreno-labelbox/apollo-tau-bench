    Non-material fields (do NOT affect this count):
      - creative_type, name, status of ads

    Rounding & comparison rules:
      - Budgets must be compared AFTER rounding to policy_snapshot.budget_rounding_unit.
      - Numeric comparisons must treat None vs. missing consistently:
          * lowest_cost => bid_amount is ignored (treat as None)
          * cost_cap    => bid_amount MUST be provided and compared numerically
      - If both pre-apply and in-plan values are equal after rounding/normalization,
        this is a NO-OP and must NOT be counted.
    
    Envelope coverage:
      - If the plan includes an adset_id that is absent from the DB, treat this as an error.
      - If an adset_id is present but the plan alloc does not change any material field,
        it must NOT contribute to applied_adsets_count.

    Use this policy whenever the instruction says: “take −40 from image adsets with CPA > 60 and assign it to video adsets with CPA < 25 within the same categories; totals fixed.”
    
    Scope
    - Apply independently per category on the target date.
    
    Eligibility
    - Donors: adsets where creative_type = image AND CPA > 60 (strict “>”).
    - Recipients: adsets where creative_type = video AND CPA < 25 (strict “<”).
    
    Amount semantics
    - Cut 40 (absolute currency units) from EACH eligible donor.
    - Respect min_budget_allocation: skip any donor if the cut would reduce its budget below min_budget_allocation.
    
    Pool & split
    - Pool = sum of all actual cuts from eligible donors in the category.
    - Recipient order is deterministic: sort by adset_id ascending.
    - Split the pool equally among recipients.
    - Round each recipient share to budget_rounding_unit.
    - Distribute any remaining rounding residue one budget_rounding_unit at a time in recipient order.
    
    Guardrails
    - If no recipients exist in a category, do not cut donors (category is a no-op).
    - If no donors exist in a category, category is a no-op.

    Instruction & Authoring Guidance
    
    - Always write instructions in second person using the seed pattern:
      "You are the {role} and the time is {timestamp}."
      This seed time is used for created_at / started_at / ended_at when the instruction
      does not provide different explicit timestamps.
    
    - Only include calendar dates/times when they differ from the seed time.
      Otherwise derive them deterministically from the seed.
    
    - Avoid enumerating specific tool names or step-by-step sequences (freeze/apply/verify/record).
      State goals and constraints; the automation expands them into the minimal, non-redundant
      actions required by policy.
    
    - Deterministic identifiers
      * author defaults to automation_agent.
      * checksum defaults to CHK001 unless explicitly provided.
      * apply_plan_allocations.request_id uses ap-{N} with N allocated sequentially within
        the task, starting at 1.
      * When provisioning a new ad and no ad_id is specified, derive ad_id as
        auto_{adset_id}_{YYYYMMDD}_{seq}, where YYYYMMDD is the event date and seq is a
        per-adset integer starting at 1 for that date. ( this does not apply to the return value of the tools! )
    
    - Name/mapping sourcing
      adset_mapping.name, category, campaign_id, bid_strategy, bid_amount, and creative_type
      must be taken from DB reads (e.g., get_adset_details_by_id) and must never be invented
      or renamed.
    
    - No-op reporting
      If apply_plan_allocations makes zero changes, return applied_adsets=[] and include
      a per-adset noops_skipped array with deterministic reasons such as
      already_in_target_state (respecting rounding rules) or below_min_budget_allocation.
    
    - Provisioning simplicity
      For straightforward provisioning (create adset + ad), do not fetch unrelated policy
      parameters or histories unless they affect a write. Use one insert_entity per row with
      deterministic IDs, then one record_automation_run with run_type="provisioning".
    """,
    """
    Deterministic Plans & Timestamps (No Fabrication)
    
    - Do NOT create a plan or call apply_plan_allocations / update_plan_status unless the instruction explicitly
      names a plan_id and asks you to apply/mark it. If no plan_id is provided, omit all plan_* actions.
    
    - plan_id must be taken verbatim from the instruction. Never invent plan IDs.
    
    - Event times:
      * If the instruction provides explicit times (or a range like “X → Y”), use those exactly.
      * If no times are provided, do not invent apply/verify/mark times. Use only the seed time
        (“You are the {role} and the time is {timestamp}.”) for created_at / started_at / ended_at as needed.
