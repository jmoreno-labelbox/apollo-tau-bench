RULES = [
    "Emergency changes can bypass standard approval workflow but must be documented within 24 hours and receive retroactive approval within 48 hours. Failure to obtain retroactive approval triggers automatic rollback.",
    "A scope baseline must be formally established and approved before the first change request can be processed. Baseline must include all deliverables, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.",
    "Multiple change requests affecting the same deliverable or work package must be consolidated into a single request. System automatically flags overlapping changes and prevents duplicate processing.",
    "Rejected change requests enter a 30-day cooling period before resubmission. Resubmitted requests must include new justification addressing original rejection reasons and demonstrate changed circumstances.",
    "Changes impacting the critical path require mandatory risk assessment with mitigation strategies. High-risk changes need contingency plans and rollback procedures documented before approval.",
