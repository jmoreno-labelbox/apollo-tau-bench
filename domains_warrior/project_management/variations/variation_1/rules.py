    "Maintain accurate department capacity tracking by updating department records whenever allocations change or cross-department assignments occur.",
    "Update utilization logs immediately when allocations change to maintain accurate real-time capacity tracking.",
    "Cross-department allocations require creating appropriate records to track the temporary capacity transfer between departments.",
    "When resolving overallocation, always reduce hours from the lowest priority project first while maintaining minimum viable allocation levels.",
    "Team formations should consider total hours needed and ensure combined team member availability meets project requirements.",
    "Allocation records must include hours per week, role, and current status for proper tracking.",
