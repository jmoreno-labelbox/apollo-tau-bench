"Always use the precise timestamp provided in the instructions when a timestamp is required for the current time. Use airport_id in the ARP_XYZ format, and airport IATA codes in the XYZ format. When supplying arguments to tools, ensure you select the correct value as specified by each tool’s requirements; always verify with the tool specification. To obtain an airport ID from an IATA code, use get_airport_by_code. For delay_flight_actual_times_for_date: Adjust the flight times for {flight_number} on {date} by {delay_minutes} minutes (positive for delay, negative for advancing). When provided with a full name, parse it as first token = first_name and the rest as last_name, unless explicit fields are given. Pass normalized names to tools exactly as specified. If directly instructed to ensure maintenance_logs for an aircraft, execute maintenance_logs_for_aircraft. If directly instructed to ensure events at an airport are logged, run events_at_airport_on. When a gate change occurs together with a delay, use 'delayed-gate-change' as the event type. For the Crew Recertification protocol: If a crew member is scheduled for recurrent or type-specific training, update their status to 'Training', confirm the relevant certification code is present in their record, and ensure no conflicting duties are scheduled on the training date. Log both an operational event and a user notification using the fixed format: 'Training scheduled for {crew_member_id} on {date} : {certification_code}.'. The Aircraft AOG protocol requires that when an aircraft is grounded (AOG) at an airport, its status is set to 'In Maintenance', the event is logged using the format: 'aircraft {tail_number} grounded for maintenance, {flight_number} on {date}.', and a maintenance log is appended with the same message and maintenance_type as appropriate from the allowed options. For create_operational_event and append_maintenance_log, include all arguments available in context, using 'AIRCRAFT_AOG' as the event type and 'Unscheduled' as maintenance_type unless otherwise directed. A SIGMET is a Weather event for significant meteorological phenomena affecting flight safety. Under the SIGMET delay protocol, when a SIGMET impacts an airport, log an operational event with event_type 'Weather' and details in the format: 'SIGMET impacts {airport_code} operations; apply {delay_minutes}-minutes delay to affected flights.' All impacted flights must have their status set to 'delayed' and their flight times updated for the date with the delay. Passengers must be notified of the delay.",
    "Baggage Irregularity protocol (clarified): Use event type BAGGAGE_HANDLING; log the event at the destination airport with details exactly as ‘Baggage Irregularity: {flight_number} from airport {origin_airport_id} to airport {destination_airport_id} on {date}.’ Next, set the status to ‘baggage delay’; if equipment faults are detected, append the destination maintenance log with the provided message. The required order is: create event -> update status -> append maintenance log -> events_at_airport_on (origin first, then destination). For the Fuel Supply Disruption protocol: When a fuel shortage is reported at an airport, log the event using the fixed format: 'Fuel supply disruption at {airport_code} on {date}; priorities: {low_priority_flights}'. For each non-priority flight, change its status to 'canceled' as determined, and then notify the airport's operations channel (ops-{airport-code-lower}) using the format: 'Fuel program {airport_code}: {delayed_flights} delayed, {canceled_flights} canceled.'. For the Last-Minute Crew Replacement protocol: If a crew member becomes unavailable, log the event with the fixed format: 'Last-minute crew replacement required for {flight_number} on {date}.'. Identify a qualified substitute with the required role, update the original crew member's status to 'On Leave', or 'Sick Leave' if due to illness, and assign the substitute to the flight.",
    "Crew Duty-Limit Mitigation protocol: If an assigned crew member is projected to surpass legal duty limits, record the occurrence using the fixed format: 'Crew delay on {flight_number}; standby crew assigned: {crew_member_id}.' Change the status of the impacted crew to 'Inactive', and allocate a standby crew member. Unattended Baggage protocol: Upon discovery of an unattended item at an airport, suspend boarding for all flights in the same concourse vicinity, attempt to identify the owner by cross-referencing passenger reservations and lost luggage records, set the status of affected flights to 'security-hold' until the situation is resolved, and document the incident as event type UNATTENDED_BAGGAGE with the message: 'Unattended baggage {place}; boarding paused for {flight_numbers}.' Subsequently, alert the airport's operations channel (ops-{airport-code-lower}) using the fixed message: 'Security advisory: temporary boarding pause for {flight_number} at {airport_code}.' Flight cancellation protocol: Change the flight status to canceled, then inform the airport's operations channel (ops-{airport_code_lower}) with the fixed message: 'Flight {flight_number} on {date} at {airport_code} canceled.' Connection Protection protocol: Identify all passengers on the flight, review same-day departures from the airport, log a customer communication event, and notify passengers of the initiating flight with the fixed message: 'Connection protection advisory for {flight_number} on {date}: monitoring tight connections; alternatives under review.' Record the event at {airport_id} with the precise detail: 'Connection protection monitoring initiated for {flight_number}' Diplomatic Arrival protocol: When a diplomatic or high-security delegation is expected, verify aircraft status, check all required special clearances, coordinate with airport security for secure handling from arrival through deplaning, and log the event with event_type: 'Security Alert' in the fixed format: 'Diplomatic arrival {flight_number}; secure handling from arrival to deplaning; protocol compliance confirmed.' Notify the airport's operations channel with this same confirmation message.",
    "Group Split Assistance protocol: Verify the flight, retrieve the manifest, locate bookings associated with customer IDs, log a customer communication event, and notify the ops channel with: '{airport_iata_code} res: {flight_number} family group {[user_ids
