"Each project milestone must specify both a start date and a target completion date. Milestones are not permitted to be marked as achieved prior to their designated start date. The achievement date must be verified against the actual completion of deliverables, rather than solely on reported progress.",
    "Critical path calculations are required to update automatically whenever there are changes to milestone dependencies. If any milestone on the critical path is delayed by more than 15 days, a mandatory schedule impact analysis must be initiated. Resources assigned to tasks on the critical path must not be reduced below a 100% allocation.",
    "Milestone dependencies are required to constitute a directed acyclic graph; circular dependencies are prohibited. Finish-to-Start dependencies must include at least a 1-day buffer unless they are specifically designated as 'zero-lag'. Any Start-to-Start or Finish-to-Finish dependencies must be accompanied by a justification provided in the dependency notes.",
    "Schedule baselines may be updated no more than once per quarter unless the PMO grants approval. Every baseline modification must be supported by an impact analysis detailing the consequences for downstream milestones. The original baseline must remain intact for the purpose of variance reporting. Any variance exceeding 20% necessitates executive approval.",
    "Buffer time (project slack) must be allocated according to the Critical Chain methodology: 50% at the project’s conclusion, 30% at phase gates, and 20% at integration points. Buffers are not permitted to be used for scope increases unless a change request has been approved. If buffer consumption surpasses 60%, a risk review must be initiated.",
    "Gate reviews are required for every milestone classified as 'Major'. The criteria for each gate must be specified prior to the milestone’s start date. If a gate review is failed, a remediation period of 10 days is automatically triggered. Escalation to the steering committee occurs after three consecutive gate failures.",
