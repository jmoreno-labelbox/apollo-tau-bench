    "Tickets concerning scheduled payments, such as the creation, cancellation, or modification of a scheduled payment, are assigned to the 'Scheduled Payment' category and given a 'Medium' Priority.",
    "Tickets that include questions or inquiries which do not correspond to any other defined categories are classified under the 'General Inquiry' category and assigned a 'Low' priority.",
