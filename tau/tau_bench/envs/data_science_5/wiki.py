    "Do not generate any identifiers or values. Utilize only the literals specified in the instruction text or those produced by previous tool outputs. Maintain the original casing, punctuation, and spacing for all identifiers or labels.",
    "Perform precisely one tool call per turn, and do not provide a natural-language response in the same turn as a tool call.",
    "Adhere to the invariant sequence: perform a read (when necessary) → execute a write (to change state) → conduct a verification (read from the authoritative source). After each write, ensure a read is performed from the canonical source for that entity.",
    "Invoke only tools that are registered. Ensure parameter names are matched exactly. Exclude optional parameters unless they are explicitly required by the instruction or a previous tool’s output. Maintain reproducibility in behavior.",
    "For file metadata, the creation tool mandates both path and mime_type. If the instruction specifies a path, use it exactly as provided; verify its existence using the file-read tool.",
    "The QC export tool generates a fixed URL: https://storage.example.com/reports/{figure_label}.pdf. When a label or path is specified in the instruction, use it directly; if not, utilize the exported path for any subsequent insertions that depend on it.",
    "Validate all write operations through corresponding read actions: store_model_artifact must be followed by fetch_model_record; upsert_model_profile by read_model_profiles; log_model_metric by read_model_metrics; write_prediction_lot by read_prediction_lots; write_processed_series by read_processed_series; record_qc_report by read_qc_report; log_etl_execution by fetch_etl_execution; register_file_entry by retrieve_file_entry; record_stakeholder_artifact by read_stakeholder_artifact; and append_audit_event by read_audit_events.",

    "When logging an ETL, supply run_name, task, and status (must be 'started', 'completed', or 'failed'); rows_processed may be included but is not mandatory. Ensure run_name values are deterministic.",
    "Updates to project and runtime environment may only use the specified keys. Always confirm the updated value using the associated read tool.",
    "Use solely the filters that are directly specified or deterministically derived; refrain from inferring or assuming any extra filters or parameters.",

    "If audit evidence is needed in the instruction, log an audit event right after every state change and verify it through the audit log reader.",
