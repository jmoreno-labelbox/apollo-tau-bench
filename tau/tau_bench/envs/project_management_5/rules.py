    "Emergency changes are permitted to bypass the standard approval workflow; however, they must be documented within 24 hours and obtain retroactive approval within 48 hours. If retroactive approval is not secured, an automatic rollback is initiated.",
    "A formal and approved scope baseline is required before processing any initial change request. The baseline must encompass all deliverables, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.",
    "All change requests that pertain to the same deliverable or work package are to be merged into one unified request. The system identifies and flags any overlapping changes, thereby blocking duplicate processing.",
    "Change requests that are rejected are subject to a 30-day cooling-off period prior to resubmission. Any resubmitted request must provide new justification that specifically addresses the reasons for the initial rejection and must show evidence of changed circumstances.",
    "Any change that affects the critical path necessitates a mandatory risk assessment, including the development of mitigation strategies. For changes classified as high-risk, contingency plans and rollback procedures must be fully documented before approval is granted.",
