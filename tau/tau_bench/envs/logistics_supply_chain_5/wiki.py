    "For international inbound shipments, customs clearance must be verified, including valid entry numbers and paid duties, before the shipment can be marked as 'Received'.",
    "Continuously track temperature-sensitive shipments. Escalate and consider rejecting any shipment exhibiting temperature deviations beyond authorized limits. Complete temperature records must be maintained.",
    "Ensure hazardous materials shipments comply with proper classifications and carrier certifications. Under no circumstances should uncertified carriers be assigned, regardless of cost or scheduling pressures.",
    "Record shipment tracking updates within 4 hours following any status modification. If a delay extends more than 24 hours beyond the estimated arrival time, inform customers and evaluate alternative routing options.",

    "Perform cycle counts on 25% of SKUs each month, prioritizing high-value and fast-moving items. Immediately investigate any discrepancies exceeding 2%.",
    "Every inventory item is required to possess a valid location ID (Zone-Row-Section-Bin). Items without assigned locations are ineligible for allocation or picking.",
    "Suppliers whose ratings fall below 4.0 are placed on 90-day improvement plans. If a supplier’s rating drops below 3.5, alternative sourcing must be initiated.",
    "Suppliers delivering on time less than 95% of the time must provide corrective action. If performance does not improve, their contracts are to be terminated.",
    "Before supplying critical items, new suppliers are required to successfully complete financial, capability, quality, and trial order evaluations.",

    "Custody logs, dual authorization, tamper-proof seals, and continuous monitoring are required for high-security items.",
    "Supervisor approval, impact analysis, and tracking are required for any changes to product, supplier, or carrier master data.",
    "Perform daily monitoring of KPIs—including inventory accuracy, fulfillment rates, and carrier performance—using automated alert systems.",
