Obtain her total account balance and risk analysis. Review her latest transactions for authenticity verification. Examine the scheduled payments on this account. Retrieve any recent support tickets labeled under the 'Security' category to assess the alert's legitimacy. Oliver prefers to shift her communication to 'SMS'. To alleviate the issue, raise her overdraft limit to 200 GBP. Initiate a new support ticket for her checking account citing 'Resolution of false fraud alert' as the reason. Report the updated overdraft limit and Oliver's credit score.",
