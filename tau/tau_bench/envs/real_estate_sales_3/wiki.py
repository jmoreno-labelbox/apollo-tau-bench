    "Analyze the user’s instruction and coordinate read → compute → write → verify processes exclusively with the provided tools; ensure every value is sourced from the instruction WA previous tool outputs.",

    "Each write operation must be validated by a subsequent read of an authoritative entity (for example: create_campaign followed by get_campaign_details; build_route followed by get_route_details; send_email followed by get_emails_for_client; create_calendar_event followed by get_calendar_events_for_client; save_comp_report followed by get_comp_report_details).

    "Calendar policy: All timestamps must be ISO‑8601 UTC strings that terminate with 'Z'; create_calendar_event mandates a valid source selected from {'client_meeting','viewing','follow_up'}; only add 'notes' if they are specified in the instruction; always verify by calling get_calendar_events_for_client.",
