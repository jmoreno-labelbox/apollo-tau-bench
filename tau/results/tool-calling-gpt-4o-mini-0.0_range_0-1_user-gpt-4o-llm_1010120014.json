        "content": "Handling a frame review request involves several steps to ensure that the process is smooth and follows the established guidelines. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Create the Frame Artifact**:\n   - Ensure that the frame is created as an artifact in your system. You will need to provide details such as the artifact type (FRAME), artifact name, Figma file ID, page ID, and any relevant tags.\n\n2. **Transform Artifact into Asset**:\n   - Before submitting a review request, you must create an asset from the artifact. This involves generating a new asset with details like export profile, file size, and storage reference.\n\n3. **Initiate a Review Cycle**:\n   - Create a new review cycle for the asset. This will include setting the initial status to IN_FLIGHT and defining the SLA deadline timestamp.\n\n4. **Start an Email Thread**:\n   - Create a Gmail thread for communication regarding the review. The subject should follow the format \"Design Review: <filename>\", and the body should include a standard message indicating the review request.\n\n5. **Notify Stakeholders**:\n   - Send notifications to relevant stakeholders using the email thread created. Ensure that the email body is formatted correctly and includes any necessary attachments.\n\n6. **Add Comments**:\n   - Synchronize comments between the Gmail thread and the Figma comments. For example, when submitting the review, add a comment stating \"Submitted for review\".\n\n7. **Handle Approval or Change Requests**:\n   - If feedback is received, update the review cycle status accordingly (e.g., APPROVED or CHANGES_REQUESTED). Ensure that comments are added to reflect the status change.\n\n8. **Document Everything**:\n   - Keep a log of all actions taken, including timestamps and brief messages for auditability.\n\n9. **Follow Up**:\n   - Monitor the review cycle and follow up as necessary to ensure timely feedback and resolution.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage a frame review request while adhering to the established guidelines and ensuring clear communication with all stakeholders.
