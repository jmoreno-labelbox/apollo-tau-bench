If not, you may need to create a new pull request from 'feature-home' to 'main'.\n\nIf you need further assistance with any of these steps, feel free to ask!",

Each object will have properties such as `number`, `title`, `head`, and `base`.\n\n2. **Locate the Pull Request Number**: Look for the `number` property within each pull request object. This number uniquely identifies the pull request in the repository.\n\n3. **Example Structure**: The pull request object might look something like this:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"number\": 42,\n       \"title\": \"Add new feature\",\n       \"head\": {\n           \"ref\": \"feature-home\"\n       },\n       \"base\": {\n           \"ref\": \"main\"\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Select the Desired Pull Request**: If you are looking for a specific pull request (e.g., one that merges from 'feature-home' to 'main'), you can check the `head.ref` and `base.ref` properties to confirm that they match your criteria.\n\nOnce you have identified the pull request number, you can use it to add labels or perform other actions as needed.

You can provide feedback or approve the changes if everything looks good.\n\n2. **Submit a Review**: If you want to provide feedback or approve the pull request, you can use the `submit_review` function. You can choose to approve, request changes, or leave a comment.\n\n   Example of approving a pull request:\n   ```javascript\n   functions.submit_review({\n       owner: 'your-username',\n       repo: 'blog-lite',\n       number: pullRequestNumber, // The number of the pull request\n       state: 'approve', // Approve the pull request\n       note: 'Looks good to me!' // Optional note\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. **Merge the Pull Request**: If the pull request is approved and all checks have passed, you can merge it into the base branch (e.g., 'main'). Use the `merge_pr` function for this.\n\n4. **Close the Pull Request**: If the pull request is no longer needed or if you decide not to merge it, you can close it using the `close_pr` function.\n\n5. **Communicate with the Team**: If you are working in a team, it might be a good idea to communicate any actions taken on the pull request, especially if you approve or merge it.\n\n6. **Monitor for Updates**: Keep an eye on the pull request for any further comments or changes from the author.\n\nChoose the actions that best fit your workflow and the current status of the pull request.
