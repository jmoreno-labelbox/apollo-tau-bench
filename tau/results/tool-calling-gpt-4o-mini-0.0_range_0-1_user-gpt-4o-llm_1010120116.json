This can help identify if the issue is a duplicate or part of a larger problem.\n\n3. **Update Crash Event Status**: If you determine that the crash is related to the asset validation issue, you can update the status of the crash event to reflect its current state (e.g., \"triaged,\" \"resolved,\" etc.).\n\n4. **Create a Bug Report**: If the crash is confirmed to be a bug, you can create a bug report with details about the crash, including steps to reproduce, environment details, and any relevant logs.\n\n5. **Notify the Team**: Send a notification to the relevant team or individuals about the crash and the actions taken. This ensures everyone is aware of the issue and can contribute to its resolution.\n\n6. **Monitor and Follow Up**: Keep track of the progress on the issue and follow up with the team as needed to ensure it gets resolved.\n\nIf you need assistance with any specific step, such as finding similar crashes or creating a bug report, feel free to ask!",
