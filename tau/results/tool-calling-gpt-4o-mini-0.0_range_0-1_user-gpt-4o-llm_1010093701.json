This is usually found in the properties panel or export section.\n\n3. **Choose PNG Format**: Select PNG as the export format.\n\n4. **Set Scale**: Set the scale to 2x. This means the exported image will be twice the size of the original asset.\n\n5. **Export**: Click the export button to save the PNG file to your desired location.\n\nMake sure to check the dimensions and quality settings to ensure the exported asset meets your requirements.

The subject should follow the format: `Design Review: <filename>`, and the body should be: `<p>Review for the <filename>. See attachment.</p>`.\n\n4. **Notify Stakeholders**: Send a notification email to the relevant stakeholders, including the asset as an attachment.\n\n5. **Add Comments**: Post a comment in the system indicating that the review has been submitted. The content should be \"Submitted for review\".\n\n6. **Approval Process**: Once the review is submitted, wait for feedback.
