Do you know which tools are currently in use?\n   - **Collaboration Tools**: Tools like Slack, Trello, or Asana might be useful for team collaboration. Should we include these in the onboarding process?\n\n3. **Team Introductions/Orientation**:\n   - **Welcome Meeting**: Planning a welcome meeting can help introduce Devin to the team. Would you like to set a date for this, or should we wait until the onboarding process is complete?\n   - **Team Lunch**: Organizing a team lunch can foster a friendly environment.

Shall we wait to set a date based on Devin\u2019s availability after onboarding?\n   - **Team Lunch**: Preferably, we can have a virtual lunch to accommodate all team members.
