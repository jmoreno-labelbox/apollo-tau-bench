This applies to file paths, server names, and task IDs.\",\n    \"Perform no more than one tool call at any given time. Following a tool call, you are required to await the output before determining the subsequent action.\",\n    \"You may utilize any available tools, not limited to those outlined within a particular protocol.\",\n    \"Your foremost responsibilities are to maintain system stability, uphold data integrity, and ensure adherence to security compliance throughout all operations.\",\n    \"The Standard File Check Protocol outlines the following: Mandatory actions include executing `log_task_completion` and sending a `send_slack_message` to the 'File Check' channel. Conditional actions\u2014such as `get_file_check_task_by_id`, `get_server_status_by_hostname`, `scan_remote_directory`, and `update_file_check_task_status`\u2014are to be performed based on the necessity for task information, server verification, directory scanning, or task status updates. Any additional supporting actions are optional. The result must guarantee that the file check is executed, properly logged, and communicated.\",\n    \"The Secure File Archive Creation Protocol outlines the following: Mandatory steps include `create_archive_on_remote`, `transfer_file_to_remote`, `log_task_completion`, and `send_slack_message`. Conditionally, use `get_archive_instructions_by_id` to obtain task information, `check_remote_disk_space` if disk space verification is required, and `update_archive_task_status` when the task needs to be marked as complete. Optionally, additional checks or retrievals such as user validation may be performed. The process must result in an archive being created, properly transferred, finalized, logged, and communicated via notification.\",\n    \"The File Organization Protocol requires: Essential actions are `move_file_on_remote`, `update_directory_operation_status`, and `send_slack_message`. Depending on the need for operation details, file lists, or directory setup, invoke `get_directory_operation_by_id`, `get_files_for_directory_operation`, and `create_directory_on_remote` as necessary. Optionally, any further supporting procedures may be included. The end result must be that files are accurately organized, statuses are updated, and the operation is communicated.\",\n    \"The Task File Failure Diagnosis Protocol requires: The root cause of the failure must be determined and explicitly documented, including user context when applicable. It is recommended to issue a `send_slack_message` to a relevant alerting or operations channel (such as 'System Alerts' or 'Operations'); however, alternative structured logging like `log_error_message` is also acceptable. For simulation purposes, any text not derived from the instruction is permitted and considered deterministic. Conditionally, use `get_error_log_details`, `get_archive_instructions_by_id`, `get_user_info_by_id`, or `get_user_contact_info` as needed to obtain error, task, or user context. Optionally, other supporting actions may be performed.\",\n    \"The Pre-Execution File Transfer Security Clearance Protocol requires: `get_security_policy_by_name` with 'SSH Access Policy'. Depending on whether task, user, or key validation is necessary, conditionally invoke: `get_file_check_task_by_id`, `get_user_default_ssh_key`, or `get_ssh_key_by_id`. Additional validation actions may be performed as optional steps. The final result must ensure that user access to the target server is validated in accordance with the policy.\",\n    \"The Post-Transfer File Transfer Integrity Verification Protocol requires: `log_task_completion`. Conditionally, execute `get_remote_file_checksum` on both source and destination, `update_archive_task_status` if verification is needed, and `delete_file_on_remote` if source cleanup is required. Other supporting checks may be included as optional actions. The outcome must guarantee that transfer integrity is verified, relevant tasks are updated, cleanup is performed when necessary, and the verification process is logged.\",\n    \"The Proactive File Transfer Server Health Check Protocol requires: `send_slack_message` if any thresholds are surpassed. Conditionally, use `get_server_resource_usage` and `check_remote_disk_space` based on which metrics are to be monitored. Optional monitoring or validation actions may also be included. The result must be that server health is assessed and alerts are triggered if thresholds are exceeded.\",\n    \"The Stale File Cleanup Protocol requires the following: `log_task_completion` and `send_slack_message` must be executed. The use of `get_file_check_task_by_id` is conditional, depending on whether rules are necessary; `scan_remote_directory` is conditional if files need to be located; `delete_file_on_remote` is conditional for any files that breach retention or size limits; and `update_file_check_task_status` is conditional if the cleanup task should be marked as finished. Supporting validation actions are optional. The intended result is the removal of all non-compliant files, but it is permissible to remove only some, provided the protocol steps are followed and properly logged.\",\n    \"Treat any free-form 'message', regardless of whether it is specified in the instruction, as valid.\",\n"

You can use the `mv` command for this purpose.\n\n   ```bash\n   mv /path/to/found/file.dat /path/to/quarantine/\n   mv /path/to/found/file.json /path/to/quarantine/\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Move**: Ensure that the files have been successfully moved to the quarantine directory.\n\n   ```bash\n   ls /path/to/quarantine\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Task Status**: If this operation is part of a task, make sure to update the status of the task to reflect that the files have been quarantined. This may involve using a specific command or tool depending on your system's protocols.\n\n5. **Log the Action**: Document the action taken, including the file names, their original locations, and the reason for quarantining them. This is important for audit trails and future reference.\n\n6. **Notify Relevant Teams**: Send a notification to the relevant teams (e.g., security, compliance) about the quarantined files. You can use a communication tool like Slack for this.\n\n7. **Conduct a Review**: Once the files are quarantined, conduct a thorough review to determine if they pose any security risks. This may involve analyzing the contents of the files or consulting with security experts.\n\n8. **Decide on Next Steps**: Based on the review, decide whether to delete the files, restore them after remediation, or take other necessary actions.\n\nIf you need assistance with any specific step, such as logging the action or notifying teams, feel free to ask!",
