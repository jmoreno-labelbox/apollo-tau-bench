This can include automated tests, code quality checks, and security scans.\n\n3. **Restrict Who Can Push**: Limit who can push directly to the main branch. Ideally, only specific roles (like maintainers) should have this permission.\n\n4. **Require Signed Commits**: Enforce that all commits to the main branch are signed, which adds an extra layer of verification.\n\n5. **Prevent Deletion**: Protect the main branch from being deleted accidentally.\n\n6. **Enforce Linear History**: Require that all merges to the main branch are done using a rebase or squash strategy to maintain a clean commit history.\n\n7. **Require Review from Code Owners**: If you have designated code owners for certain parts of the codebase, require their review for changes that affect their areas.\n\nTo check if these settings are in place, you would typically look in your repository settings under \"Branches\" or \"Branch Protection Rules.\" If you need help with specific configurations or have questions about implementing these rules, feel free to ask!",
