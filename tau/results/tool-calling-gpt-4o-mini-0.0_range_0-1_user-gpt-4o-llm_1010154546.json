If a required field or row does not exist, issue an error and refrain from performing any write operations.\",\n    \"Behavior must remain deterministic at all times. Do not invoke clocks or random number generators.

If a proposed change would exceed these limits, adjust it to the closest permissible value or omit it, providing a deterministic justification (such as 'would_break_min_per_cat').\",\n    \"If instructions specify 'keep totals fixed', ensure that the total of allocations within the specified scope remains precisely the same after rounding is applied.\",\n    \"Rounding procedures must be deterministic. When allocations require rounding, perform rounding to whole currency units only after calculating the complete allocation, and resolve any remaining difference by assigning it to deterministic tie-break winners.\",\n    \"Budget writes are required to comply with per-adset constraints specified in policy_params: min_daily, max_daily, max_pct_step, min_abs_step, rounding increment, daily_change_limit, and cooldown_hours.\",\n    \"Prior to applying a budget change: (a) restrict the new value to the range [min_daily, max_daily\n"
