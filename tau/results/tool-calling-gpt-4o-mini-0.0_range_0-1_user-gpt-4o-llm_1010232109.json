However, every attempt to register the event results in the following error: \n```\n'str' object has no attribute 'get'\n```\n\n**Steps Taken**:\n1. We initially attempted to register the CI event with the following parameters:\n   - Provider: GitHub Actions\n   - Run ID: run_001\n   - Status: failed\n   - Repo: game-engine\n   - Branch: feature/new-renderer\n   - Commit SHA: abc123def456789\n   - Job Name: Windows build\n\n2. After encountering the error, we reviewed the documentation and attempted to include an optional parameter (`environment: 'Windows'`), but this resulted in a different error indicating that the parameter was unexpected.\n\n3. We reverted to the original parameters but continued to face the same error.\n\n**Request for Assistance**:\nCould you please investigate this issue and provide guidance on how to successfully register the CI event? Any insights into the expected parameters or potential issues with the function would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for your assistance!\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Position]  \n[Your Contact Information]  \n\n---\n\nFeel free to modify any part of the message as needed.
