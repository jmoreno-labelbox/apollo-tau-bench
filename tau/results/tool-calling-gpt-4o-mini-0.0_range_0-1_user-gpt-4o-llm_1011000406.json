Ensure that any version constraints are compatible with other dependencies in the project.\n\n3. **Clean and Rebuild**: After updating the dependency, clean the build environment to remove any cached or outdated files. This can often be done with commands like `npm clean-install`, `pip uninstall`, or similar commands depending on the package manager being used.\n\n4. **Re-run the CI Pipeline**: Trigger the CI pipeline again to see if the issue is resolved. Monitor the build logs for any new errors or warnings.\n\n5. **Document the Change**: If the update resolves the issue, document the change in your version control system (e.g., commit the updated dependency file) and communicate the change to your team.\n\nIf you need to make any specific changes to the CI configuration or if you want to log this issue as a work item, please let me know, and I can assist you with that!",
