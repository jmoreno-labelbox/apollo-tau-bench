This can give you insights into their effectiveness and areas for improvement.\n\n4. **Automated Tracking:** If possible, implement an automated system that updates the \"times_used\" count each time a promotion is applied during a transaction.\n\n5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review the performance of promotions and adjust them based on usage data and customer feedback.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, feel free to reach out.
