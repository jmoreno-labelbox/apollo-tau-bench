Here's a structured approach you can follow:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Artifacts\n- **Locate the Design Artifacts**: Use tags or specific criteria to filter and find the relevant design artifacts in your design tool (e.g., Figma).\n\n### Step 2: Export Artifacts\n- **Export the Artifacts**: Once you've identified the artifacts, export them in the required formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF) for sharing with reviewers.\n\n### Step 3: Create Review Cycle\n- **Initiate a Review Cycle**: Create a review cycle for each artifact, specifying the status (e.g., NEEDS_REVIEW) and any relevant details.\n\n### Step 4: Notify Stakeholders\n- **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Send out notifications to stakeholders or team members about the review, including links to the artifacts and any specific feedback requests.\n\n### Step 5: Gather Feedback\n- **Collect Feedback**: After the review, gather feedback from stakeholders and make necessary adjustments to the artifacts.\n\n### Step 6: Finalize Artifacts\n- **Finalize the Artifacts**: Once feedback is incorporated, finalize the artifacts for implementation or further development.\n\n### Tools and Functions\nIf you're using a tool like Figma, you can utilize specific functions to filter artifacts by tags, export them, and create review cycles. If you need assistance with any of these steps, let me know, and I can help you execute them!",
