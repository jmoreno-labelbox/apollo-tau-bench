Verify that the version specified is compatible with the rest of the project.\n\n3. **Update Dependency Management**: If the dependency is missing from the configuration files, add it. If it is already present but not being recognized, consider updating the dependency management tool (e.g., running `npm install`, `pip install`, or `gradle build`).\n\n4. **Verify Environment Setup**: Ensure that the build environment is correctly set up. This includes checking environment variables, paths, and any required system libraries that need to be installed.\n\n5. **Rebuild the Project**: After making the necessary changes, trigger a rebuild of the project to see if the issue is resolved.\n\n6. **Run Tests**: If the build succeeds, run any existing tests to ensure that the changes did not introduce new issues.\n\n7. **Document the Changes**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made to the dependencies or build configuration.\n\n8. **Create a Pull Request**: If the changes are successful, create a pull request with a summary of the fixes made, linking it to the original issue or build failure.\n\nIf you would like to proceed with any specific steps, such as drafting a fix proposal or creating a pull request, please let me know!",
