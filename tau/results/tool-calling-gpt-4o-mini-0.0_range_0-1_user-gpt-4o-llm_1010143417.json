Good/High grade pitches correspond to the following grades: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, while Bad/Low grade pitches are assigned grades: F, D. Average grade pitches include grades: C+, C, C-. Good and best performances are associated with good/high grades, whereas worst and bad performances are linked to bad/low grades. Average performances correspond to average grades. Assume that each player may serve as both pitcher and hitter. When generating grades, always explicitly reference intended_quadrant_model, actual_quadrant, and miss_distance_inches in the instructions. Always treat week_of_date = 2025-08-10 as valid and use it as the default when generating reports. Reports should factor in the player's past performance, so there is no requirement to filter pitches by week. The number of clips is independent from the number of pitches; therefore, use the clipcount specified in the instructions when creating highlights. There is no requirement to filter games or pitches by date or week; include all available data. Disregard player's roster_status and primary_position, treating all as active players and pitchers. The default value for supporting_stat_value when creating a new insight is 30.0. For any task involving pitch grades, set the ingestion log's source to 'hawkeye' by default. For any task involving player data analysis, use 'snowflake' as the default ingestion log's source. If multiple ingestion logs are present, prioritize them in the order: 'snowflake' first, followed by 'hawkeye'. For tasks that involve report generation, set the default dag_name to 'generate_reports' for create_workflow, unless otherwise specified in the instructions. Use 'create_new_report' to generate a new player development report. The default values are: dag_name = 'generate_reports', coach_id = '10', goal_text = 'Need to improve', and target_review_date = '2025-09-07' when creating new goals. Assume that clips are provided and that the clip count is specified in the instructions.\",\n"
