Once the registration issue is resolved and you have completed the necessary steps leading up to the draft PR, here\u2019s how you can initiate the draft PR:\n\n1. **Open an Automation Branch**: Create a branch named 'auto/fix-run_001' based on the appropriate base reference (usually the main or development branch).\n\n2. **Draft the PR**: Use the following templates for the PR:\n   - **Commit Message**: `auto tentative fix for run run_001`\n   - **PR Title**: `auto fix build break run_001`\n   - **PR Body**: `summary for run run_001`\n\n3. **Link the Ticket**: If you have created or updated a ticket, ensure it is linked to the PR.\n\n4. **Trigger Smoke Validation**: After the PR is created, initiate smoke validation to ensure the changes are stable.\n\nOnce you are ready to proceed with these steps, please let me know, and I can assist you with the specific tool calls to create the automation branch and draft PR.",

        "content": "In addition to reviewing the logs and artifacts, here are a few more recommendations that could help you in the triage process:\n\n1. **Collaborate with Team Members**: If you have colleagues who are familiar with the affected areas of the code, consider discussing the issue with them. They may have insights or previous experiences that could expedite the resolution.\n\n2. **Check Recent Changes**: Look at the recent commits in the repository, especially those made to the branch where the failure occurred. This can help identify any changes that might have introduced the issue.\n\n3. **Run Local Tests**: If possible, try to replicate the build failure locally. Running tests in your local environment can help you understand the problem better and may lead to a quicker fix.\n\n4. **Document Findings**: As you review logs and artifacts, document any findings or hypotheses about the cause of the failure. This will be useful when creating the ticket or drafting the PR.\n\n5. **Prepare for Future Incidents**: Consider whether there are any preventive measures that could be implemented to avoid similar failures in the future, such as improving test coverage or adding additional CI checks.\n\n6. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on any updates or changes in the CI/CD pipeline that might affect the build process. Sometimes, external factors can contribute to build failures.\n\n7. **Follow Up on the Ticket**: If a ticket has already been created for this issue, monitor its status and any comments from team members or stakeholders.\n\nBy taking these additional steps, you can enhance your understanding of the issue and contribute to a more effective resolution.

Here are a few final suggestions to keep in mind as you work through the triage process:\n\n1. **Prioritize Communication**: Keep your team informed about your findings and any progress you make. Regular updates can help ensure everyone is aligned and can contribute if needed.\n\n2. **Utilize Version Control**: If you identify a potential fix, consider creating a local branch to test your changes before proposing them in a draft PR. This allows you to validate your solution without affecting the main codebase.\n\n3. **Review Documentation**: If there are any relevant documentation or coding standards, review them to ensure that your proposed changes align with the project's guidelines.\n\n4. **Be Open to Feedback**: Once you draft your fix proposal or PR, be open to feedback from your peers. Collaborative reviews can lead to better solutions and catch potential issues early.\n\n5. **Reflect on the Process**: After resolving the issue, take some time to reflect on the triage process. Consider what worked well and what could be improved for future incidents.\n\n6. **Stay Organized**: Keep your notes and findings organized, as they may be useful for future reference or for onboarding new team members.\n\n7. **Take Breaks**: If you find yourself stuck or frustrated, take a short break. Sometimes stepping away for a moment can provide clarity and fresh perspectives.\n\nIf you follow these suggestions, you'll be well-equipped to handle the CI triage task effectively.
