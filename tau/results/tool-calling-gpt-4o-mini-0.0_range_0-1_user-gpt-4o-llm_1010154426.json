Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Schedule the Reminder:\n\n1. **Open Your Calendar Application**: Use Google Calendar, Outlook, or any other calendar tool you prefer.\n\n2. **Create a New Event**:\n   - **Title**: \"Packet follow-up\"\n   - **Date and Time**: Set the event for **August 21, 2025**, from **23:00 to 23:10 UTC**.\n   - **Location**: Set it as a phone call.\n   - **Notes**: You can leave this blank or add any specific details you want to remember.\n\n3. **Set a Reminder**: Most calendar applications allow you to set a reminder notification (e.g., 10 minutes before the event).\n\n4. **Save the Event**: Make sure to save the event so that it appears in your calendar.\n\nIf you need any further assistance or have questions about this process, feel free to ask!",
