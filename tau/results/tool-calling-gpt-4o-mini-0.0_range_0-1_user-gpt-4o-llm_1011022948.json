The versions of `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` are consistent across environments, but there may be differences in how they handle data insertion.\n- The environment paths and installed packages seem appropriate for data processing tasks.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check for Constraints**: There may be constraints or validation rules in the data insertion process that are not immediately visible. \n2. **Test Data Insertion**: I can attempt to insert a simpler data point to see if the issue persists.\n3. **Generate QC Report**: Once the data insertion issue is resolved, we can proceed to generate a quality control report.\n\nWould you like to proceed with testing a simpler data insertion, or do you have another approach in mind?",

This could include primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, or any validation rules that might prevent the insertion of new rows.\n\n2. **System Logs**: \n   - Look for any error logs or system logs that might provide information about failed data insertion attempts. This could include application logs, database logs, or any monitoring tools in use.\n\n3. **Consult with a Database Administrator (DBA)**: \n   - If you have access to a DBA or someone who manages the database, they may be able to provide insights into any issues or constraints that are not immediately visible.\n\nOnce you have gathered more information from these reviews, we can determine the next steps to resolve the data insertion issue and proceed with generating the quality control report.\n\nIf you need assistance with anything else or have further questions, please let me know!",
