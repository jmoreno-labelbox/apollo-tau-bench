This typically includes requirements for pull request reviews, status checks, and restrictions on who can push to the branch.\n\n2. **Security Measures**: Review the security settings, including:\n   - Code scanning alerts: Ensure that code scanning is enabled and that any alerts are addressed.\n   - Dependency vulnerability checks: Verify that dependency scanning is in place to catch vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.\n\n3. **Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the repository and that permissions are set according to the governance policy.\n\nIf you have access to the repository settings, you can manually check these aspects. Alternatively, if you can provide me with specific details or configurations, I can help you analyze them for compliance.",
