However, since I cannot directly access the data rows, I can guide you on how to perform this analysis.\n\n1. **Count High-Risk Flags**: Check how many entries have the `high_risk_flag` set to true (or 1).\n2. **Analyze Correlations**: For the entries marked as high-risk, examine the associated values of:\n   - `tide_pred_m`\n   - `wind_speed_ms`\n   - `precipitation_mm_hr`\n   - `pressure_hpa`\n   - `temperature_c`\n\n3. **Identify Patterns**: Look for patterns in the timestamps to see if high-risk conditions are clustered around specific dates or weather events.\n\nIf you have access to the dataset, you can perform these steps using a data analysis tool or programming language like Python or R. If you need further assistance with this analysis or have specific questions, please let me know!",
