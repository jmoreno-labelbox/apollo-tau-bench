        "content": "Certainly! Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to manually set up the email-based design review for your Figma artifact:\n\n### Step 1: Create the Review Cycle\n1. **Determine the Review Cycle ID**: Choose a unique identifier for your review cycle (e.g., `cycle_001`).\n2. **Prepare the Recipients**: Ensure you have the email addresses of the recipients ready. In your case, they are:\n   - design-review@company.com\n   - ux-team@company.com\n3. **Set the Start Time**: Use the timestamp for when the review cycle is starting. You have:\n   - **Timestamp**: 2024-08-23T10:00:00Z\n\n### Step 2: Create the Gmail Thread\n1. **Subject**: Decide on a subject for the email thread (e.g., \"Design Review for Artifact art_001\").\n2. **Sender Email**: Use your email address as the sender.\n3. **Labels**: Apply the official review label, which is \"Design/Needs-Review\".\n4. **Create the Thread**: Use your email client to create a new email thread with the above details and include the recipients.\n\n### Step 3: Send the Initial Email\n1. **Compose the Email**: Write a brief introduction about the design review, including:\n   - The purpose of the review.\n   - A link to the Figma artifact.\n   - Any specific feedback you are looking for.\n2. **Send the Email**: Once you are satisfied with the content, send the email to the recipients.\n\n### Step 4: Manage the Review Cycle\n1. **Track Responses**: Monitor the email thread for responses and feedback from the recipients.\n2. **Update the Review Cycle Status**: As you receive approvals or feedback, update the status of the review cycle accordingly.\n\n### Step 5: Finalize the Review\n1. **Summarize Feedback**: Once the review period is over, summarize the feedback received.\n2. **Communicate Outcomes**: Send a follow-up email to all participants with the outcomes of the review and any next steps.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- Keep the email thread organized by replying to the original email for all communications related to the review.\n- If you need to document approvals or decisions, consider using a shared document or spreadsheet.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about any of these steps or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",

Make sure the purpose of the review and any specific areas you want feedback on are well articulated.\n\n2. **Set a Deadline**: If possible, specify a deadline for feedback to ensure timely responses. This helps keep the review process on track.\n\n3. **Follow-Up Reminders**: If you don\u2019t receive responses by the deadline, consider sending a gentle reminder to the recipients.\n\n4. **Organize Feedback**: As feedback comes in, organize it in a way that makes it easy to review and act upon. You might use a shared document or spreadsheet to track comments and decisions.\n\n5. **Acknowledge Contributions**: Thank the participants for their feedback and contributions. This fosters a collaborative environment and encourages future participation.\n\n6. **Document Everything**: Keep a record of all communications, decisions, and approvals related to the review cycle. This documentation can be valuable for future reference.\n\n7. **Use Tags Effectively**: If your email client supports tagging or labeling, use them to categorize emails related to the review for easy retrieval later.\n\n8. **Be Open to Feedback**: Encourage open and honest feedback. Remind participants that constructive criticism is welcome and essential for improving the design.\n\n9. **Iterate on Feedback**: Be prepared to iterate on your design based on the feedback received. This shows that you value the input of your team and are committed to improving the design.\n\nIf you keep these tips in mind, you'll be well on your way to a successful design review process.
