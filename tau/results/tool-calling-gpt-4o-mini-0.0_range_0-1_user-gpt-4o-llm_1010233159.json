Since I cannot access the repository or create the issue directly, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Branch Protection Rules**: Review the governance policy requirements for branch protection. Common rules include:\n   - Require pull request reviews before merging.\n   - Require status checks to pass before merging.\n   - Restrict who can push to the branch.\n\n2. **Operational Issue**: Since there is an existing operational issue titled 'Configure main branch protection rules', you may want to ensure that it includes:\n   - Clear objectives for what the branch protection should enforce.\n   - A timeline for implementation.\n   - Assigned responsibilities for monitoring compliance.\n\nIf you have specific details about the governance policy requirements or the current status of the operational issue, please share them, and I can help you draft a plan or checklist to ensure compliance.",
