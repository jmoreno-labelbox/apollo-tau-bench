Good/High grade pitches correspond to the following grades: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, while Bad/Low grade pitches are assigned grades: F, D. Average grade pitches include grades: C+, C, C-. Good and best performances are associated with good/high grades, whereas worst and bad performances are linked to bad/low grades. Average performances correspond to average grades. Assume that each player may serve as both pitcher and hitter. When generating grades, always explicitly reference intended_quadrant_model, actual_quadrant, and miss_distance_inches in the instructions. Always treat week_of_date = 2025-08-10 as valid and use it as the default when generating reports. Reports should factor in the player's past performance, so there is no requirement to filter pitches by week. The number of clips is independent from the number of pitches; therefore, use the clipcount specified in the instructions when creating highlights. There is no requirement to filter games or pitches by date or week; include all available data. Disregard player's roster_status and primary_position, treating all as active players and pitchers. The default value for supporting_stat_value when creating a new insight is 30.0. For any task involving pitch grades, set the ingestion log's source to 'hawkeye' by default. For any task involving player data analysis, use 'snowflake' as the default ingestion log's source. If multiple ingestion logs are present, prioritize them in the order: 'snowflake' first, followed by 'hawkeye'. For tasks that involve report generation, set the default dag_name to 'generate_reports' for create_workflow, unless otherwise specified in the instructions. Use 'create_new_report' to generate a new player development report. The default values are: dag_name = 'generate_reports', coach_id = '10', goal_text = 'Need to improve', and target_review_date = '2025-09-07' when creating new goals. Assume that clips are provided and that the clip count is specified in the instructions.\",\n"

Here are some actionable steps for each pitcher:\n\n### Lucas Garcia\n1. **Enhance Secondary Pitches**\n   - **Drills:**\n     - **Bullpen Sessions:** Dedicate specific bullpen sessions to focus solely on secondary pitches. Use a mix of live batting practice and drills to simulate game situations.\n     - **Targeted Pitching Drills:** Incorporate drills that emphasize grip, release, and movement of secondary pitches. Use targets to improve accuracy.\n   - **Video Analysis:**\n     - Record bullpen sessions and analyze the effectiveness of secondary pitches. Look for adjustments in grip and release that can enhance pitch quality.\n\n2. **Increase Velocity**\n   - **Strength Training:**\n     - Implement a strength and conditioning program focused on lower body and core strength, which are crucial for generating pitching velocity. Exercises like squats, deadlifts, and plyometrics can be beneficial.\n   - **Velocity Drills:**\n     - Use weighted balls or resistance bands during training to build arm strength and improve velocity. Incorporate drills that focus on explosive movements.\n   - **Regular Monitoring:**\n     - Track progress in velocity during practice and games. Use radar guns to measure pitch speed and adjust training intensity accordingly.\n\n### James Brown\n1. **Refine Mechanics**\n   - **Mechanics Drills:**\n     - Focus on drills that emphasize proper mechanics, such as balance drills, stride drills, and follow-through exercises. Use slow-motion video to analyze and correct mechanics.\n   - **Feedback Sessions:**\n     - Schedule regular feedback sessions with coaches to review mechanics and make necessary adjustments. Use video analysis to highlight areas for improvement.\n\n2. **Improve Pitch Selection**\n   - **Game Simulation:**\n     - Conduct simulated games where James practices pitch selection based on different hitting scenarios. Use data from previous games to inform decisions.\n   - **Study Opponents:**\n     - Analyze video footage of opposing hitters to understand their weaknesses and tendencies.

      {
        "content": "Tracking progress over time is crucial for ensuring that Lucas Garcia and James Brown are effectively implementing their improvement strategies and achieving their goals. Here are some recommendations for tracking their progress:\n\n### 1. **Establish Baseline Metrics**\n   - Before starting the training routines, establish baseline metrics for each targeted area. This could include current pitch velocities, whiff rates, release point consistency, and other relevant statistics.\n   - Document these baseline metrics in a shared performance log or database for easy reference.\n\n### 2. **Create a Progress Tracking System**\n   - **Performance Log:**\n     - Maintain a performance log that records key metrics after each training session and game. Include details such as pitch types, velocities, execution grades, and any qualitative observations.\n   - **Weekly Reviews:**\n     - Schedule weekly reviews to analyze the performance log. Discuss progress, challenges, and any necessary adjustments to training routines.\n\n### 3. **Utilize Technology for Data Collection**\n   - **Pitch Tracking Systems:**\n     - Use pitch tracking technology (e.g., TrackMan, Rapsodo) to gather data on pitch performance, including velocity, spin rate, and movement. This data can provide insights into the effectiveness of secondary pitches and overall mechanics.\n   - **Video Analysis Tools:**\n     - Regularly record training sessions and games. Use video analysis software to break down mechanics and pitch selection, allowing for visual feedback and adjustments.\n\n### 4. **Set Short-Term and Long-Term Goals**\n   - **Short-Term Goals:**\n     - Set specific, measurable short-term goals for each training cycle (e.g., increase fastball velocity by 2 mph within four weeks).\n   - **Long-Term Goals:**\n     - Establish long-term goals that align with overall performance objectives (e.g., achieve a strikeout rate below a certain threshold by the end of the season).\n\n### 5. **Feedback Mechanism**\n   - **Coaching Feedback:**\n     - Encourage regular feedback from coaches during training sessions. This can help identify areas for improvement and reinforce positive changes.\n   - **Self-Assessment:**\n     - Have Lucas and James conduct self-assessments after each session, reflecting on what worked well and what needs further attention.\n\n### 6. **Adjust Training Based on Data**\n   - Use the collected data to make informed decisions about training adjustments. If certain pitches are consistently underperforming, allocate more time to drills focused on those pitches.\n   - If progress is being made in one area, consider shifting focus to another area that may need attention.\n\n### 7. **Celebrate Milestones**\n   - Recognize and celebrate milestones achieved along the way, whether it's reaching a specific velocity, improving pitch command, or successfully implementing a new pitch. This can boost motivation and morale.\n\nBy implementing a structured approach to tracking progress, both Lucas Garcia and James Brown can stay focused on their improvement objectives and make data-driven decisions to enhance their performance over time.
