Unfortunately, without the ability to execute the command, I cannot proceed with creating the secret at this moment.\n\nAs an alternative, you can manually create the secret through your cloud management console. Here are the general steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Access the Secrets Manager**: Log in to your cloud provider's management console and navigate to the Secrets Manager service.\n\n2. **Create a New Secret**: Look for an option to create a new secret.\n\n3. **Specify the Secret Details**:\n   - **Name**: Use a name like `redis-auth-header-secret`.\n   - **Description**: Optionally, provide a description indicating that this secret is for the Redis AUTH header.\n   - **Secret Value**: Enter the actual AUTH value that you want to use for the Redis connection.\n\n4. **Save the Secret**: After entering the details, ensure to save or apply the secret.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further assistance with the manual process, feel free to ask!",

This ARN is typically available in the Secrets Manager where you created the secret.\n\n3. **Set the Partition Key**: If you are using the default partition key for the UAT environment, it will be `dcomm-uat`. If you have a different partition key, you can specify that instead.\n\n4. **Configure Cache Integration**: Use the `configure_cache_integration` function to set up the integration with the cache. You will need to provide the following parameters:\n   - **external_url**: The cache endpoint URL.\n   - **auth_header_secret_arn**: The ARN of the secret you created for the AUTH header.\n   - **partition_key**: The partition key (default is `dcomm-uat`).\n\nIf you have the secret ARN ready, please provide it, and I can help you configure the cache integration. If you need assistance retrieving the ARN, let me know!",
