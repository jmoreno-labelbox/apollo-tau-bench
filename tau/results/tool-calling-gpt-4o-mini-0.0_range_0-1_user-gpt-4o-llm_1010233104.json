This is often specified in a build script or CI configuration file.\n\n3. **Check for Errors**:\n   - Monitor the output for any errors or warnings that occur during the build process. Pay special attention to any logs that indicate what might be going wrong.\n\n4. **Debugging**:\n   - If the build fails, try to isolate the issue by commenting out recent changes or dependencies to see if the build succeeds without them.\n\n5. **Consult Logs**:\n   - If available, check the local logs for more detailed error messages that can provide insight into the failure.\n\nIf you encounter specific errors during this process, feel free to share them, and I can help you analyze them further!",
