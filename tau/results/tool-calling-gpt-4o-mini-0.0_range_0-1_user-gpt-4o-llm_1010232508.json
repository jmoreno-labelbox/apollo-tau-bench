The report should be created with:\n   - `game_pk`: '2024000013'\n   - `report_type`: 'pre-series'\n   - `insights_data`: empty (since there are no insights)\n\n2. For the video playlist:\n   - Ensure that the `report_id` references the report you will create.\n   - Set a deterministic `internal_portal_link`.\n   - Set `clip_count` to zero.\n\nOnce you have confirmed these parameters, you can proceed to create the report and the video playlist. After that, remember to log the workflow run with `dag_name='scouting'` and `status='success'`, and post the report in the Slack channel '#coaches-prep'. \n\nLet me know when you're ready to proceed or if you need assistance with any specific step!",
