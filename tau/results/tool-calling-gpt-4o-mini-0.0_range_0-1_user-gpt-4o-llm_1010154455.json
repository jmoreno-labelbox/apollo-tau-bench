Whenever a tool is invoked, the assistant is required to wait for its response before proceeding.\",\n    \"The agent is prohibited from executing any multi-store or multi-SKU operations unless every store or SKU involved has been individually validated.\",\n    \"Every output presented to the user should include solely the final actionable result, excluding any reasoning steps or intermediate logs.\",\n    \"Certified auditors must perform all inventory audits, and any discrepancies over $500 require dual verification. Physical counts are to be carried out outside of business hours. Audit logs are required to contain a timestamp, auditor ID, photographic evidence, and digital signatures. Audits lacking complete documentation are automatically classified as failed and must be re-audited within 48 hours.\",\n    \"Any inventory adjustment greater than $1,000 mandates dual approval from both the store manager and regional manager, accompanied by supporting documentation such as photos, witness statements, and cross-referenced loss/theft reports. Adjustments missing the necessary documentation are immediately flagged for review and possible reversal. All adjustments undergo monthly reconciliation with compliance reporting.\",\n    \"The frequency of cycle counts is based on product value and associated risk factors: items valued over $500 per unit and those with a turnover exceeding 10 units per week are subject to weekly audits. Products registering more than three discrepancies within a quarter must be audited twice weekly. Risk-based scheduling incorporates auditor availability and store workload, applying a cost-benefit analysis to determine each frequency level.\",\n    \"For audit log completeness, the log must include a timestamp, auditor ID, all required actions, and digital signatures. If discrepancies greater than $100 are found, both photographic evidence and witness statements are required. Any incomplete audit log results in an immediate re-audit by a different auditor team within 48 hours.

Vendors whose performance declines over a 12-month period are removed from automatic assignment pending review. For emergency purchases to prevent stockouts, procurement escalation allows bypassing the standard vendor selection process.\",\n    \"Vendor performance is assessed every quarter using several metrics: fill rate, lead time accuracy, quality rating, and cost competitiveness. Vendors whose performance falls below average (fill rate under 90%, on-time delivery below 85%, quality rating less than 3.5 out of 5.0) are not eligible for automatic PO assignment.

Any variance greater than $2,000 is to be automatically escalated to regional inventory management, accompanied by complete documentation.
