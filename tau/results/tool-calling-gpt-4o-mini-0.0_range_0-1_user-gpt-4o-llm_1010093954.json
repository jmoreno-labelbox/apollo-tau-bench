This is usually under \"Branches\" or \"Branch Protection\" settings.\n\n4. **Create a New Branch Protection Rule**:\n   - Click on the option to add a new branch protection rule.\n\n5. **Configure Protection Settings**:\n   - **Require pull request reviews before merging**: This ensures that all changes are reviewed before they are merged into the main branch.\n   - **Require status checks to pass before merging**: Specify any CI/CD checks that must pass before a pull request can be merged.\n   - **Include administrators**: Decide if the rules should apply to administrators as well.\n   - **Restrict who can push to matching branches**: Limit push access to specific users or teams.\n\n6. **Save Changes**:\n   - After configuring the rules, save the changes to apply the branch protection.\n\n7. **Communicate the Changes**:\n   - Inform your team about the new branch protection rules and ensure they understand the process for making changes to the repository.\n\n### Next Steps\nOnce the repository is created and the branch protection rules are set up, you can then verify the existence of the specified commits ('docs: Add MIT License' and 'docs: Add SECURITY.md policy') authored by 'docs-sophia'. \n\nIf you need assistance with any specific part of this process or if you encounter any issues, feel free to ask!",
