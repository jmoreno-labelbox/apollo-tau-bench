This could be instructions on how to contribute, coding standards, or any other relevant information.\n\n### Step 2: Create a New Branch\n1. **Branch Name**: Create a new branch for your changes. A common practice is to name it something like `add-contributing-guidelines`.\n\n### Step 3: Add the File to the New Branch\n1. **Add the File**: Once the branch is created, add the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with the content you prepared.\n\n### Step 4: Commit the Changes\n1. **Commit Message**: Use a clear commit message like \"Add contribution guidelines\".\n\n### Step 5: Create a Pull Request\n1. **Pull Request Title and Body**: Provide a title and description for your pull request, explaining what changes you made and why.\n\n### Example Workflow\nIf you provide me with the following details, I can help you execute these steps:\n- **Repository Owner**: The GitHub username or organization name.\n- **Repository Name**: The name of the repository.\n- **Content for the File**: The text you want to include in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.\n- **Your GitHub Username**: For the commit author.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can create the new file, commit it, and create a pull request for you!",

This helps ensure that someone else looks over your changes before they are merged.\n\n3. **Address Feedback**:\n   - If reviewers provide feedback or request changes, make the necessary updates in your branch.\n   - After making changes, commit them and push to the same branch. The pull request will automatically update with your new commits.\n\n4. **Merge the Pull Request**:\n   - Once the pull request is approved and all feedback has been addressed, you can merge it into the main branch.\n   - You can do this directly on GitHub by clicking the \"Merge pull request\" button.\n\n5. **Delete the Branch** (Optional):\n   - After merging, you can delete the feature branch if it is no longer needed. GitHub usually provides an option to delete the branch after merging.\n\n6. **Celebrate Your Contribution**:\n   - Congratulations! You've successfully added contribution guidelines to the project. It's a great way to help future contributors.\n\nIf you need assistance with any of these steps or have any questions, feel free to ask!",
