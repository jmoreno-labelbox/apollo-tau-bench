The active conversation under consideration is thread_001, which requires a standardized triage posture and eligibility for synchronization. Ensure alignment with the organization's DLP configuration and intent keywords to maintain secure communication and consistent stakeholder reporting. The coordination goal is to create a stakeholder-ready record in which thread_001 shows a triaged, figma-sync status with the 'urgent' designation removed effective 2024-08-22T12:00:00Z. A DLP assessment should confirm the conversation is clean, offering timestamped evidence for audit transparency and Figma synchronization. Constants to maintain: label design-review; participant chris.engineer@company.com; keyword Design; thread_id thread_001; add_labels [triaged, figma-sync]; remove_labels [urgent]; changed_ts 2024-08-22T12:00:00Z.",
