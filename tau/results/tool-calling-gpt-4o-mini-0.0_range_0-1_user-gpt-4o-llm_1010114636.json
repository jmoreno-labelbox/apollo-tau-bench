Good/High grade pitches correspond to the following grades: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, while Bad/Low grade pitches are assigned grades: F, D. Average grade pitches include grades: C+, C, C-. Good and best performances are associated with good/high grades, whereas worst and bad performances are linked to bad/low grades. Average performances correspond to average grades. Assume that each player may serve as both pitcher and hitter. When generating grades, always explicitly reference intended_quadrant_model, actual_quadrant, and miss_distance_inches in the instructions. Always treat week_of_date = 2025-08-10 as valid and use it as the default when generating reports. Reports should factor in the player's past performance, so there is no requirement to filter pitches by week. The number of clips is independent from the number of pitches; therefore, use the clipcount specified in the instructions when creating highlights. There is no requirement to filter games or pitches by date or week; include all available data. Disregard player's roster_status and primary_position, treating all as active players and pitchers. The default value for supporting_stat_value when creating a new insight is 30.0. For any task involving pitch grades, set the ingestion log's source to 'hawkeye' by default. For any task involving player data analysis, use 'snowflake' as the default ingestion log's source. If multiple ingestion logs are present, prioritize them in the order: 'snowflake' first, followed by 'hawkeye'. For tasks that involve report generation, set the default dag_name to 'generate_reports' for create_workflow, unless otherwise specified in the instructions. Use 'create_new_report' to generate a new player development report. The default values are: dag_name = 'generate_reports', coach_id = '10', goal_text = 'Need to improve', and target_review_date = '2025-09-07' when creating new goals. Assume that clips are provided and that the clip count is specified in the instructions.\",\n"

Focusing on precision can help him achieve better execution grades.\n\n2. **Reduce Miss Distance:**\n   - **Goal:** Decrease the miss distance to within 3 inches for all pitches.\n   - **Rationale:** His miss distance was 6.56 inches for one pitch and 3.96 inches for another. Reducing this distance can lead to more effective pitches and higher grades.\n\n3. **Enhance Pitch Types:**\n   - **Goal:** Work on developing secondary pitch types to complement his primary pitches.\n   - **Rationale:** Diversifying his pitch arsenal can make him less predictable and improve overall performance.\n\n4. **Increase Spin Rate:**\n   - **Goal:** Aim to increase the spin rate of his pitches by 100-200 RPM.\n   - **Rationale:** Higher spin rates can lead to better movement and deception, potentially improving his effectiveness against hitters.\n\n5. **Focus on Velocity Consistency:**\n   - **Goal:** Maintain a consistent velocity range for his pitches.\n   - **Rationale:** Consistency in velocity can help hitters adjust less effectively, leading to better outcomes.\n\n6. **Leverage Index Management:**\n   - **Goal:** Work on managing leverage index to optimize pitch selection in high-pressure situations.\n   - **Rationale:** Understanding when to use specific pitches based on leverage can improve performance in critical game moments.\n\nThese goals can be tailored further based on specific areas of focus during training sessions and game situations. Would you like to create a development goal for James Brown based on these suggestions?",

Focusing on location can lead to better execution and higher grades.\n\n2. **Minimize Miss Distance:**\n   - **Goal:** Aim to reduce the miss distance to within 2 inches for all pitches.\n   - **Rationale:** His miss distance was 0.66 inches for one pitch, which is good, but maintaining this level consistently can enhance overall effectiveness.\n\n3. **Develop Secondary Pitches:**\n   - **Goal:** Work on refining secondary pitches to provide more options during at-bats.\n   - **Rationale:** A diverse pitch mix can keep hitters off balance and improve performance.\n\n4. **Increase Spin Rate:**\n   - **Goal:** Target an increase in spin rate by 100-200 RPM on key pitches.\n   - **Rationale:** Higher spin rates can enhance pitch movement and effectiveness, making it harder for hitters to make solid contact.\n\n5. **Velocity Control:**\n   - **Goal:** Maintain a consistent velocity range while also working on increasing velocity by 1-2 MPH.\n   - **Rationale:** Consistency in velocity can help in maintaining effectiveness, while a slight increase can add to the challenge for hitters.\n\n6. **Leverage Index Optimization:**\n   - **Goal:** Focus on pitch selection based on leverage index to maximize effectiveness in high-pressure situations.\n   - **Rationale:** Understanding when to use specific pitches can improve performance during critical moments in games.\n\n7. **Mental Approach:**\n   - **Goal:** Work on mental strategies for handling pressure situations and maintaining focus.\n   - **Rationale:** A strong mental game can enhance performance, especially in high-leverage situations.\n\nThese targets can be incorporated into his training regimen to help him improve his overall performance on the mound.
