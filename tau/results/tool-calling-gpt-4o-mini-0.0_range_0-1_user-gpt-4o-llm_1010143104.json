This may include compiled binaries, logs, or any other output files generated during the build process.\n   - Click on the artifacts to view or download them. The URIs may be displayed directly, or you may need to copy the links.\n\n3. **Access Logs**:\n   - There should also be a section for logs, which may include console output or log files generated during the build.\n   - Review the logs for any errors or warnings that could provide insight into the failure.\n\n4. **Copy URIs**:\n   - Once you have located the artifacts and logs, copy their URIs. They should follow a consistent format, often starting with `artifact://` or a similar prefix.\n\nOnce you have gathered the URIs, please share them with me, and I can assist you in attaching them to the run.",
