Good/High grade pitches correspond to the following grades: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, while Bad/Low grade pitches are assigned grades: F, D. Average grade pitches include grades: C+, C, C-. Good and best performances are associated with good/high grades, whereas worst and bad performances are linked to bad/low grades. Average performances correspond to average grades. Assume that each player may serve as both pitcher and hitter. When generating grades, always explicitly reference intended_quadrant_model, actual_quadrant, and miss_distance_inches in the instructions. Always treat week_of_date = 2025-08-10 as valid and use it as the default when generating reports. Reports should factor in the player's past performance, so there is no requirement to filter pitches by week. The number of clips is independent from the number of pitches; therefore, use the clipcount specified in the instructions when creating highlights. There is no requirement to filter games or pitches by date or week; include all available data. Disregard player's roster_status and primary_position, treating all as active players and pitchers. The default value for supporting_stat_value when creating a new insight is 30.0. For any task involving pitch grades, set the ingestion log's source to 'hawkeye' by default. For any task involving player data analysis, use 'snowflake' as the default ingestion log's source. If multiple ingestion logs are present, prioritize them in the order: 'snowflake' first, followed by 'hawkeye'. For tasks that involve report generation, set the default dag_name to 'generate_reports' for create_workflow, unless otherwise specified in the instructions. Use 'create_new_report' to generate a new player development report. The default values are: dag_name = 'generate_reports', coach_id = '10', goal_text = 'Need to improve', and target_review_date = '2025-09-07' when creating new goals. Assume that clips are provided and that the clip count is specified in the instructions.\",\n"

      {
        "content": "Yes, let's proceed with comparing Lucas Garcia's Knuckle Curve performance metrics against ideal performance metrics. Here's how we can define the ideal performance for a Knuckle Curve:\n\n### Ideal Performance Metrics for a Knuckle Curve:\n1. **Execution Grade**: Ideally, a grade of **A-** or higher is desirable for a high-performing pitch.\n2. **Intended Quadrant Model**: The ideal quadrant for a Knuckle Curve is typically **Quadrant 8**, which is often aimed at the lower part of the strike zone, making it difficult for hitters to make solid contact.\n3. **Actual Quadrant**: The actual quadrant should ideally match the intended quadrant (Quadrant 8) or be very close to it (e.g., Quadrant 7 or 9).\n4. **Miss Distance**: A miss distance of less than **3 inches** is generally considered acceptable for maintaining effectiveness. A miss distance greater than this can lead to more hittable pitches.\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Execution Grade**: B- (Needs improvement to reach A- or higher)\n- **Intended Quadrant Model**: 8 (Ideal)\n- **Actual Quadrant**: 2 (Significant deviation from the intended quadrant)\n- **Miss Distance**: 6.56 inches (Above the acceptable range)\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Execution Grade**: The B- grade indicates that while the pitch is somewhat effective, there is room for improvement to reach a higher level of execution.\n- **Quadrant Deviation**: The actual quadrant being 2 instead of the intended quadrant 8 suggests that Lucas may be releasing the pitch too high or not getting the desired downward movement.\n- **Miss Distance**: A miss distance of 6.56 inches indicates that the pitch is not landing close to the target, which can lead to more hits and runs.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Identify Specific Areas for Improvement**: Focus on the release point and mechanics to ensure the pitch lands in the intended quadrant.\n2. **Training Drills**: Implement drills that emphasize control and accuracy for the Knuckle Curve.\n3. **Video Analysis**: Review video footage of his Knuckle Curve pitches to identify mechanical flaws.\n\nWould you like to proceed with identifying specific improvement strategies based on this analysis?",

Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Adjust Grip and Release Point**: Work with a pitching coach to refine the grip and adjust the release point to ensure that the ball is delivered consistently toward Quadrant 8.\n\n2. **Control-Focused Drills**: Incorporate drills that emphasize hitting the target quadrant, such as simulated games or bullpen sessions that track pitch accuracy.\n\n3. **Mechanics Check-Up**: Conduct video analysis sessions to examine Lucas's throwing mechanics and identify any potential flaws or inconsistencies that could be affecting pitch accuracy.\n\nHow does this strategy sound, and would you like to establish measurable goals next?"
