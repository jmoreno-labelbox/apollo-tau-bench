You already have the bug ticket ID (BUG-1027).\n\n2. **Link the Work Items**: Use the linking functionality in your project management system to create a relationship between the crash event and the bug ticket. Specify the relationship type as 'duplicate'.\n\nIf you have access to the linking functionality in your system, you can typically do this through a user interface. If you need assistance with the specific steps in your system, please let me know, and I can provide more detailed guidance! \n\nIf you want me to attempt to link them programmatically, please provide the crash event ID and I can try that as well.",
