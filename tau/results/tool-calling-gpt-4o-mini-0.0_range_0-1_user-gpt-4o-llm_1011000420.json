You'll need to provide details like the artifact type, name, Figma file ID, page ID, and owner email.\n\n2. **Transform Artifact into Asset**: Once the artifact is created, you need to create a new asset linked to that artifact. You'll specify the export profile, file size, and storage reference.\n\n3. **Create a Review Cycle**: After the asset is created, initiate a new review cycle for the asset. You'll need to set the SLA deadline timestamp and optionally link it to a Gmail thread.\n\n4. **Start an Email Thread**: Create a new Gmail thread for the review request. You'll need to set the subject line, sender identity, recipients, and the body of the email.\n\n5. **Send the Review Request**: Once the email thread is created, you can send the review request email, which includes the details of the review.\n\n6. **Add Comments**: After submitting the review, add a comment to the artifact indicating that it has been submitted for review.\n\n### Required Information\n- **Artifact Details**: Name, Figma file ID, page ID, owner email.\n- **Asset Details**: Export profile, file size, storage reference.\n- **Review Cycle Details**: SLA deadline timestamp.\n- **Email Thread Details**: Subject, recipients, body content.\n\nWould you like to proceed with any specific step?
