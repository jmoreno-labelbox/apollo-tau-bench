The following methods are approved for user authentication:\n     - **Username and Password**: Users must create strong passwords that meet the following criteria:\n       - Minimum length of 12 characters.\n       - Inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n       - Passwords must be changed every 90 days.\n       - Users are prohibited from reusing the last five passwords.\n\n2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n   - Multi-factor authentication is required for accessing critical systems and sensitive data. Users must provide at least two of the following authentication factors:\n     - **Something You Know**: A password or PIN.\n     - **Something You Have**: A physical device such as:\n       - Hardware tokens (e.g., RSA SecurID, YubiKey).\n       - Mobile authentication apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).\n       - SMS or email codes sent to registered devices.\n     - **Something You Are**: Biometric verification methods such as:\n       - Fingerprint recognition.\n       - Facial recognition.\n       - Iris scanning.\n\n3. **Session Management**\n   - User sessions must automatically time out after a period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes) to prevent unauthorized access.\n   - Users must re-authenticate after a session timeout or when accessing sensitive functions.\n\n4. **Account Lockout Policy**\n   - Accounts will be temporarily locked after a specified number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts) to prevent unauthorized access.\n   - Users must follow a defined process to unlock their accounts, which may include answering security questions or contacting IT support.\n\n5. **User Responsibilities**\n   - Users are responsible for safeguarding their authentication credentials and must not share them with others.\n   - Users must report any suspected compromise of their credentials immediately to the IT department.\n\n### Conclusion\n- Emphasize the importance of strong user authentication practices in protecting critical systems and data from unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adjust any details or add specific methods that your organization uses.
