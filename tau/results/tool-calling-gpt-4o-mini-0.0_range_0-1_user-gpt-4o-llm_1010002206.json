Review them to ensure everything looks correct.\n\n6. **Add a title and description**: Provide a title for your pull request and a description of the changes you made. This helps reviewers understand the purpose of your PR.\n\n7. **Create the pull request**: Click the \"Create Pull Request\" button to submit your PR.\n\nAfter creating the pull request, the repository maintainers will be able to review your changes, provide feedback, and eventually merge them into the main branch.

Be prepared to respond to any comments or suggestions.\n\n2. **Address Feedback**: If you receive any feedback, make the necessary changes in your local branch (`feature-branch`), commit those changes, and push them to the same branch. The pull request will automatically update with your new commits.\n\n3. **Merge the Pull Request**: Once your pull request is approved, you or a maintainer can merge it into the main branch. This is usually done by clicking the \"Merge pull request\" button on the pull request page.\n\n4. **Delete the Branch**: After the pull request is merged, you can delete the `feature-branch` if it\u2019s no longer needed. GitHub usually provides an option to delete the branch right after merging.\n\n5. **Celebrate Your Contribution**: Congratulations on contributing to the project!

Consider what went well and what you might improve for future contributions.\n\n4. **Engage with the Community**: If the repository has a community (like a chat channel or forum), consider engaging with other contributors or maintainers. This can help you learn more and build relationships.\n\n5. **Look for More Issues**: If you're interested in contributing further, check the repository for open issues or feature requests that you can help with.\n\n6. **Document Your Experience**: If you learned something new during this process, consider documenting it for future reference or sharing it with others.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!",
