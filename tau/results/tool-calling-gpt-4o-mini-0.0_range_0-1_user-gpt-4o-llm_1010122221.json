This protocol involves: get_daily_insights_for_adset, calculate_adset_roas_for_day, find_underperforming_adsets, update_adset_budget, and log_budget_change. It detects underperforming ad sets with a ROAS below 1.5, decreases their budgets by 20%, identifies top-performing ad sets with a ROAS above 3.0, increases their budgets by 15%, and records all modifications with the reason 'plan_2025-08-13'.\",\n    \"During budget updates, each budget amount must be rounded to the nearest $10 increment, in accordance with the budget_rounding_unit policy parameter.\",\n    \"The aggregate daily budget for all ad sets must not surpass the max_daily_budget_total policy parameter limit of $20,000.\",\n    \"For any active ad set, the allocated budget must be at least $100, as defined by the min_budget_allocation policy parameter.\",\n    \"Any modification to the budget must be recorded via log_budget_change, including old_budget, new_budget, adset_id, and the reason for the adjustment.\",\n    \"Every audit log entry must utilize the standardized reason format 'plan_2025-08-13' to ensure uniformity and enable traceability for all automated operations.\",\n    \"When modifying bid strategies in response to performance metrics, the 'Bid Strategy Optimization Protocol' is required.

        "content": "That sounds like a great focus! Designing effective surveys is crucial for gathering high-quality data that can inform your customer personas. Here are some best practices for survey design:\n\n### 1. **Define Clear Objectives**\n   - **Identify Goals**: Before creating the survey, clearly define what you want to learn. This will help you formulate relevant questions and keep the survey focused.\n   - **Target Specific Personas**: Tailor your survey to gather insights specific to the personas you are developing.\n\n### 2. **Keep It Short and Focused**\n   - **Limit Length**: Aim for a survey that takes no more than 5-10 minutes to complete. Longer surveys may lead to lower completion rates.\n   - **Prioritize Questions**: Include only essential questions that align with your objectives. Remove any unnecessary or redundant questions.\n\n### 3. **Use Clear and Concise Language**\n   - **Avoid Jargon**: Use simple, straightforward language that is easy for respondents to understand. Avoid technical terms or industry jargon.\n   - **Be Specific**: Frame questions clearly to avoid ambiguity. For example, instead of asking \"How often do you shop?\" specify \"How many times do you shop for electronics in a month?\"\n\n### 4. **Choose the Right Question Types**\n   - **Closed-Ended Questions**: Use multiple-choice, rating scales, or yes/no questions for quantitative data. These are easier to analyze and provide clear insights.\n   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Include a few open-ended questions to gather qualitative insights. This allows respondents to express their thoughts in their own words.\n   - **Balanced Scales**: When using rating scales, ensure they are balanced (e.g., 1-5 or 1-7 scales) to avoid bias.\n\n### 5. **Logical Flow and Structure**\n   - **Group Related Questions**: Organize questions into sections based on themes (e.g., demographics, preferences, behaviors) to create a logical flow.\n   - **Use Skip Logic**: Implement skip logic to direct respondents to relevant questions based on their previous answers, making the survey more personalized.\n\n### 6. **Incorporate Demographic Questions**\n   - **Collect Relevant Demographics**: Include questions about age, gender, location, income, and other relevant demographics to help segment responses.\n   - **Respect Privacy**: Ensure that demographic questions are optional if they may make respondents uncomfortable.\n\n### 7. **Test the Survey**\n   - **Pilot Testing**: Conduct a pilot test with a small group of people to identify any confusing questions or technical issues before launching the survey.\n   - **Gather Feedback**: Ask pilot participants for feedback on the survey experience and make necessary adjustments.\n\n### 8. **Incentivize Participation**\n   - **Offer Incentives**: Consider providing incentives (e.g., discounts, gift cards) to encourage participation and increase response rates.\n   - **Communicate Value**: Clearly communicate the purpose of the survey and how the insights will be used to improve products or services.\n\n### 9. **Follow Up and Thank Respondents**\n   - **Send Thank You Messages**: After the survey is completed, send a thank-you message to participants to show appreciation for their time.\n   - **Share Results**: If appropriate, share key findings or insights from the survey with respondents to demonstrate the impact of their input.\n\n### 10. **Analyze and Act on Results**\n   - **Data Analysis**: Use statistical tools to analyze quantitative data and identify trends. For qualitative data, look for common themes and insights.\n   - **Implement Changes**: Use the insights gathered from the survey to inform your customer personas and make data-driven decisions.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can design effective surveys that yield valuable insights for creating accurate customer personas.
