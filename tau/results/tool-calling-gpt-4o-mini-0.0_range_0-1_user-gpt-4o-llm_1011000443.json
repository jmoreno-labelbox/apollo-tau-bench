Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to execute a file scan once you have access to the server:\n\n1. **Connect to the Server**: Use SSH to connect to the designated server. The command typically looks like this:\n   ```\n   ssh username@server_address\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Target Directory**: Determine the directory you want to scan for files. This could be a specific folder where files are stored.\n\n3. **Run the File Scan**: Use the `find_and_stat_files` tool to scan the target directory. You will need to specify:\n   - `target_directory`: The path of the directory you want to scan.\n   - `last_access_days`: The number of days to look back for file access (e.g., 30 for files accessed in the last 30 days).\n   - `parallel_processes`: You can use the default value of 6 for parallel processing.\n\n   The command will look something like this:\n   ```javascript\n   find_and_stat_files({\n       target_directory: \"/path/to/your/directory\",\n       last_access_days: 30,\n       parallel_processes: 6\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Review the Results**: After the scan is complete, review the results to see the metadata of the files found.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: Depending on the results, you may want to filter the files, move them, or perform other actions based on your requirements.\n\nIf you need further assistance with any specific step or tool, feel free to ask!",

      {
        "content": "To verify the integrity of the resulting log file after completing the scan, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Compute the Checksum**: Use the `compute_checksum` tool to generate a SHA256 checksum for the log file. This checksum will serve as a reference for integrity verification.\n\n   The command will look like this:\n   ```javascript\n   compute_checksum({\n       log_name: \"file_check_log.json\" // Replace with the actual log file name if different\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Copy the Log File (if necessary)**: If you need to transfer the log file to another location (e.g., a remote server), use the `copy_file_to_host` tool to copy the log file along with its checksum.\n\n   The command will look like this:\n   ```javascript\n   copy_file_to_host({\n       log_name: \"file_check_log.json\" // Replace with the actual log file name if different\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Local Checksum**: After copying the log file, use the `verify_local_checksum` tool to re-compute the checksum of the copied log file and compare it with the original checksum.\n\n   The command will look like this:\n   ```javascript\n   verify_local_checksum({\n       log_name: \"file_check_log.json\" // Replace with the actual log file name if different\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Review the Verification Result**: Check the output of the verification process. If the checksums match, the integrity of the log file is confirmed. If they do not match, there may have been an issue during the transfer or file handling.\n\n5. **Cleanup Temporary Files (if applicable)**: If you created any temporary files during the process, you can delete them using the `local_cleanup` tool.\n\nIf you need assistance with any specific command or tool, feel free to ask!",
