This protocol involves: get_daily_insights_for_adset, calculate_adset_roas_for_day, find_underperforming_adsets, update_adset_budget, and log_budget_change. It detects underperforming ad sets with a ROAS below 1.5, decreases their budgets by 20%, identifies top-performing ad sets with a ROAS above 3.0, increases their budgets by 15%, and records all modifications with the reason 'plan_2025-08-13'.\",\n    \"During budget updates, each budget amount must be rounded to the nearest $10 increment, in accordance with the budget_rounding_unit policy parameter.\",\n    \"The aggregate daily budget for all ad sets must not surpass the max_daily_budget_total policy parameter limit of $20,000.\",\n    \"For any active ad set, the allocated budget must be at least $100, as defined by the min_budget_allocation policy parameter.\",\n    \"Any modification to the budget must be recorded via log_budget_change, including old_budget, new_budget, adset_id, and the reason for the adjustment.\",\n    \"Every audit log entry must utilize the standardized reason format 'plan_2025-08-13' to ensure uniformity and enable traceability for all automated operations.\",\n    \"When modifying bid strategies in response to performance metrics, the 'Bid Strategy Optimization Protocol' is required.
