For example:\n   ```bash\n   sudo chown your_username:your_group /var/log\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Changes**: After making changes, run the `ls -ld /var/log` command again to verify that the permissions or ownership have been updated correctly.\n\n5. **Retry the File Scan**: Once the permissions are set correctly, you can attempt to run the file scan again.\n\nPlease ensure that you have the necessary administrative privileges to make these changes.
