Once you have all the video clips ready for Scott Arnold and James Brown, I can assist you with creating the video playlists and logging the workflow execution details. Here\u2019s how we can proceed:\n\n### Steps to Create Video Playlists\n\n1. **Create Video Playlists for Scott Arnold**:\n   - **Positive Reinforcement Playlist**: 4 clips\n   - **Teaching Moments Playlist**: 3 clips\n\n2. **Create Video Playlists for James Brown**:\n   - **Positive Reinforcement Playlist**: 5 clips\n   - **Teaching Moments Playlist**: 2 clips\n\n### Workflow Execution Log Details\n\nOnce the playlists are created, we can log the workflow execution details. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to prepare for that:\n\n- **DAG Name**: This could be something like \"Weekly Development Packages\".\n- **Game PK**: If applicable, otherwise it can be left out.\n- **Status**: Indicate whether the workflow was successful or if there were any issues.\n- **Start Time UTC**: The timestamp when the workflow started.\n- **End Time UTC**: The timestamp when the workflow completed.\n- **Log S3 Path**: A path to where the logs are stored, if applicable.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Gather Video Clips**: Make sure you have the clips ready for both players.\n2. **Create Playlists**: Once you have the clips, I can help you create the playlists.\n3. **Log Workflow Execution**: After the playlists are created, we can log the execution details.\n\nFeel free to reach out when you have the clips ready or if you need assistance with any specific part of the process!",

        "content": "It seems that I'm currently unable to generate the `run_id` for the workflow execution due to a technical issue. However, I can guide you on how to create a unique `run_id` manually.\n\n### Generating a Unique `run_id`\n\nA common approach to generate a unique identifier is to use a combination of the current timestamp and a random string or number. Here\u2019s a simple format you can use:\n\n1. **Format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random_string>`\n2. **Example**: If the workflow was completed on August 11, 2025, at 11:30 AM UTC, you could generate a `run_id` like this:\n   - `20250811-113000-XYZ123`\n\n### Steps to Create the `run_id`\n\n1. **Use the Date and Time**: Start with the date and time of the workflow completion.\n2. **Add a Random String**: Append a random string or number to ensure uniqueness.\n\n### Example `run_id`\n\n- **Generated `run_id`**: `20250811-113000-abc123`\n\nFeel free to customize the random string as needed. Once you have your `run_id`, you can log it along with the workflow execution details. If you need further assistance or have any questions, just let me know!",
