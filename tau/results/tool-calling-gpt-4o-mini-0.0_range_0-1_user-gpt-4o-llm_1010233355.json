Adjustments missing the necessary documentation are immediately flagged for review and possible reversal. All adjustments undergo monthly reconciliation with compliance reporting.\",\n    \"The frequency of cycle counts is based on product value and associated risk factors: items valued over $500 per unit and those with a turnover exceeding 10 units per week are subject to weekly audits.
