Make sure you have the correct export profile specified.\n\n3. **Send Email to Stakeholders**: Prepare an email to stakeholders, attaching the exported assets. The email should include a subject and body that clearly communicate the purpose of the review.\n\n4. **Tag the Artifact**: At the kickoff of the review, apply the 'needs-review' tag to the artifact.\n\n5. **Log the Run**: Record the automation run for tracking purposes.\n\nIf you provide me with the specific details such as the artifact ID, export profile, and the stakeholders' email addresses, I can help you execute these steps!",
