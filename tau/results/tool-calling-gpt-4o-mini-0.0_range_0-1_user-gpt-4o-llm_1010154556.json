Good/High grade pitches correspond to the following grades: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, while Bad/Low grade pitches are assigned grades: F, D. Average grade pitches include grades: C+, C, C-. Good and best performances are associated with good/high grades, whereas worst and bad performances are linked to bad/low grades. Average performances correspond to average grades. Assume that each player may serve as both pitcher and hitter. When generating grades, always explicitly reference intended_quadrant_model, actual_quadrant, and miss_distance_inches in the instructions. Always treat week_of_date = 2025-08-10 as valid and use it as the default when generating reports. Reports should factor in the player's past performance, so there is no requirement to filter pitches by week. The number of clips is independent from the number of pitches; therefore, use the clipcount specified in the instructions when creating highlights. There is no requirement to filter games or pitches by date or week; include all available data. Disregard player's roster_status and primary_position, treating all as active players and pitchers. The default value for supporting_stat_value when creating a new insight is 30.0. For any task involving pitch grades, set the ingestion log's source to 'hawkeye' by default. For any task involving player data analysis, use 'snowflake' as the default ingestion log's source. If multiple ingestion logs are present, prioritize them in the order: 'snowflake' first, followed by 'hawkeye'. For tasks that involve report generation, set the default dag_name to 'generate_reports' for create_workflow, unless otherwise specified in the instructions. Use 'create_new_report' to generate a new player development report. The default values are: dag_name = 'generate_reports', coach_id = '10', goal_text = 'Need to improve', and target_review_date = '2025-09-07' when creating new goals. Assume that clips are provided and that the clip count is specified in the instructions.\",\n"

Focusing on precision will help him place pitches more effectively within the intended zones.\n\n2. **Quadrant Targeting:**\n   - **Objective:** Enhance targeting of the intended quadrant model (8).\n   - **Rationale:** Since the actual quadrant was 2, working on understanding and executing pitches that align more closely with the intended quadrant will improve overall performance.\n\n3. **Pitch Variety and Strategy:**\n   - **Objective:** Develop a strategy for varying pitch types to keep hitters off balance.\n   - **Rationale:** Incorporating a mix of pitch types can help James become less predictable and improve his effectiveness on the mound.\n\n4. **Mental Focus and Game Situations:**\n   - **Objective:** Work on mental preparation and focus during high-leverage situations.\n   - **Rationale:** Enhancing mental toughness can help him maintain composure and execute pitches more effectively under pressure.\n\nThese objectives can be tailored into specific drills and practice sessions to help James Brown improve his performance in future games. Would you like to set a specific development goal for him based on these priorities?",

The focus should be on maintaining this level of precision across all pitches.\n\n2. **Enhance Pitch Execution:**\n   - **Objective:** Work on refining pitch execution to improve the actual quadrant alignment with the intended quadrant model (6).\n   - **Rationale:** While the miss distance is small, the actual quadrant was 3, indicating that there is still room for improvement in hitting the intended target more accurately.\n\n3. **Pitch Type Development:**\n   - **Objective:** Expand the repertoire of pitch types and improve command over secondary pitches.\n   - **Rationale:** Developing additional pitches can make Lucas more versatile and effective against different hitters, allowing him to adapt his strategy based on game situations.\n\n4. **Game Situation Awareness:**\n   - **Objective:** Improve situational awareness and decision-making during high-pressure moments.\n   - **Rationale:** Enhancing his ability to read the game and make strategic decisions can lead to better outcomes, especially in critical situations.\n\nThese objectives can be incorporated into Lucas's training regimen to help him build on his current strengths and further enhance his performance.
