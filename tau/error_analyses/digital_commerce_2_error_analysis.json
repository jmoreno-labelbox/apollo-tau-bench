This error prevents the agent from executing the necessary actions to retrieve product information, verify stock, calculate prices, apply discounts, and create a case, as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The error indicates a possible issue with the environment's code or configuration, which is causing the failure to define or access a required variable or function, thus halting the process."
