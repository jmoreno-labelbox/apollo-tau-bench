This indicates a malfunction in the environment's handling of the tool's response or the data structure being used, preventing the agent from proceeding with the necessary actions to complete the task. The ground truth action sequence involves multiple steps that require interaction with the environment, such as verifying stock and calculating prices, which were not executed due to this error."
