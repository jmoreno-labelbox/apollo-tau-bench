This indicates a malfunction in the environment's handling of the tool's responses, preventing the assistant from executing the necessary actions to complete the task. The ground truth action sequence involves multiple steps that require interaction with the environment, such as verifying stock and calculating prices, which are not possible due to the persistent error."
