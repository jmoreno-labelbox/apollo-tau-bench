This error prevents the execution of any actions, as the system repeatedly encounters this issue without progressing through the necessary steps of the offboarding process. The ground truth action sequence outlines a series of actions that should have been executed, but the trajectory shows that none of these actions were performed due to the environment's failure to handle the error."
