The errors such as \"'module' object is not callable\", \"name '_require' is not defined\", and \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicate that there are issues with the environment's code or configuration, which prevent the agent from performing the necessary operations to retrieve user and household information, compute nutrition targets, create a meal plan, and generate a grocery list. These errors are not related to the logic of the task but rather to the environment's inability to execute the required functions."
