Instead of returning a structured object that the assistant could parse, it returned a string, leading to repeated errors ('str' object has no attribute 'get') when the assistant attempted to access attributes of the expected object. This prevented the assistant from proceeding with the subsequent actions required to fulfill the user instruction."
