The agent encountered errors due to missing required arguments ('lives_in_house' and 'relation') for the `MemberManager.invoke()` method, which were not needed according to the ground truth action sequence.

The ground truth action sequence specifies using `MemberManager` with the `action` \"get\" and `member_id` \"john_johnson\". However, in the trajectory, the `MemberManager` tool is invoked incorrectly, resulting in errors about missing required positional arguments: 'lives_in_house' and 'relation'. These arguments are not needed according to the ground truth, indicating that the tool was used with the wrong arguments."
