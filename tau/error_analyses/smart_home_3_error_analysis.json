The agent attempted to create a scene but encountered errors due to missing or incorrect scene data, resulting in multiple \"Invalid action\" and \"scene_data required\" errors. Additionally, the agent incorrectly reported the creation of a scene with actions that did not match the user instruction, such as turning on a bedside light instead of the Master Bedroom ceiling light at 60% brightness. The agent also failed to retrieve the current status of all devices in the Master Bedroom before establishing the automation, which was a required step in the ground truth action sequence."

Specifically, the assistant mentioned creating a scene with actions that included turning on a \"bedside light to 80% brightness\" and turning on a \"coffee machine,\" which were not part of the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required setting the \"Master Bedroom ceiling light\" to 60% brightness, opening the \"Master Bedroom curtain\" fully, and adjusting the \"central heater\" in the basement to 22 degrees Celsius in heating mode. The assistant used incorrect device actions and did not follow the specified scene actions in the ground truth."
