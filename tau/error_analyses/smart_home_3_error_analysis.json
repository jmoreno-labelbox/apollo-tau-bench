The error message indicates that the `MemberManager.invoke()` method was missing the `lives_in_house` and `relation` arguments, which were not required in the ground truth action sequence. This suggests that the agent incorrectly attempted to use additional arguments that were not necessary, leading to repeated errors and preventing the completion of the task."

The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `MemberManager` should be invoked with the `action` set to \"get\" and the `member_id` set to \"john_johnson\". However, in the trajectory, the `MemberManager` tool is invoked without the required arguments `lives_in_house` and `relation`, leading to an error. This indicates that the tool was used with the wrong arguments, causing the failure to retrieve Robert Johnson's member details as intended."
