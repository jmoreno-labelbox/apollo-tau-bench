This resulted in continuous errors and prevented the agent from retrieving Robert Johnson's member details, which was the first step in the ground truth action sequence. Consequently, the agent failed to proceed with any subsequent actions necessary to set up the morning schedule."

The ground truth action sequence specifies that the \"MemberManager\" should be invoked with the \"action\" set to \"get\" and the \"member_id\" set to \"john_johnson\". However, in the trajectory, the \"MemberManager\" tool is repeatedly invoked without providing the required \"member_id\" argument, leading to errors. This discrepancy indicates the use of the wrong tool argument in the trajectory."
