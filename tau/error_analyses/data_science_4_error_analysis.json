            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to several key issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Geocoding**: The agent initially provided the geographical coordinates for Portland, WA instead of Portland, OR, which is a critical error as the project is focused on Portland, OR.\n\n2. **Failure to Set Project Configuration**: The agent repeatedly failed to set the project configuration due to missing required parameters (`forecast_horizon_days` and `max_station_distance_km_nullable`). This indicates a lack of proper handling of user-provided information and failure to execute the `setProjectConfig` action correctly.\n\n3. **Weather Forecast Retrieval Errors**: The agent consistently encountered errors when attempting to retrieve the weather forecast data due to incorrect parameter usage (`latitude`, `longitude`, `horizon_days`). This shows a misunderstanding of the required parameters for the `setWeatherForecast` action.\n\n4. **Incomplete Data Acquisition**: The agent did not successfully acquire the weather forecast data, which is a crucial component of the project. This failure prevented the completion of the ETL process and the overall project setup.\n\nThese issues highlight the agent's inability to correctly execute the necessary actions to fulfill the user instruction, leading to an incomplete and faulty trajectory."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the `SetWeatherForecast` tool was invoked with incorrect arguments. In the ground truth action sequence, the `setWeatherForecast` action is supposed to be called with the `city_name` argument set to \"Portland\". However, in the trajectory, the tool was incorrectly invoked with `latitude` and `longitude` arguments, which are not expected by the `SetWeatherForecast` tool, leading to errors. This discrepancy in the arguments used is the functional difference causing the fault."
