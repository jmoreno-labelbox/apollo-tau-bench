            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to several issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Parameter Handling**: The agent repeatedly failed to invoke the `setProjectConfig` function correctly by not providing the required parameters `forecast_horizon_days` and `max_station_distance_km_nullable`, despite the user providing these details later in the conversation.\n\n2. **Incorrect Function Invocation**: The agent attempted to invoke the `FindNoaaStation` and `SetWeatherForecast` functions with incorrect parameters, leading to errors. Specifically, it used unexpected keyword arguments like 'radius_km', 'latitude', 'longitude', and 'horizon_days', which were not part of the expected function signature.\n\n3. **Incomplete Data Collection**: The agent failed to gather the weather forecast data due to persistent errors and did not resolve these issues, resulting in an incomplete dataset for the project.\n\n4. **Incorrect File Path Logging**: The agent did not correctly log all the necessary file paths in the project's main file directory, as it failed to create the weather forecast data file.\n\nThese issues indicate a lack of proper error handling, parameter validation, and adherence to the expected action sequence, leading to the failure in achieving the task as per the user instruction."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the `SetWeatherForecast` tool was invoked with incorrect arguments such as 'latitude', 'longitude', and 'horizon_days', which are not part of the expected parameters. In the ground truth action sequence, the `setWeatherForecast` tool is correctly invoked with the argument `city_name: \"Portland\"`. This discrepancy in the arguments used for the `SetWeatherForecast` tool led to errors and prevented the successful gathering of weather forecast data."
