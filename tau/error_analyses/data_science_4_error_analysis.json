            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to several issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Geocoding**: The agent repeatedly retrieved the geocoding for Seattle instead of Portland, which led to incorrect data being used for subsequent actions. The correct latitude and longitude for Portland were not used until the user provided them manually.\n\n2. **Improper Handling of Errors**: The agent encountered multiple errors with the `SetProjectConfig` and `SetWeatherForecast` functions due to missing or incorrect parameters. The agent failed to resolve these issues effectively, leading to repeated errors and a lack of progress in setting up the project.\n\n3. **Failure to Correctly Execute Actions**: The agent did not correctly execute the `setWeatherForecast` action, as it used incorrect parameters and failed to adjust its approach based on the errors received.\n\nOverall, the agent's inability to correctly configure the project and handle errors led to the failure in achieving the desired outcome as per the ground truth action sequence."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is due to the incorrect use of arguments in the `setWeatherForecast` tool. The ground truth specifies that the `setWeatherForecast` function should be invoked with the argument `city_name: \"Portland\"`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to use incorrect arguments such as `latitude`, `longitude`, and `horizon_days`, which are not valid for this function, leading to errors. This discrepancy in the function arguments is the reason for the \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
