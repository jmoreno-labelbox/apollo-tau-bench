In the ground truth action sequence, the `setProjectConfig` action specifies a `forecast_horizon_days` of 7 and a `max_station_distance_km_nullable` of 50.0. However, in the trajectory, the agent did not set these parameters, as indicated by the `forecast_horizon_days` and `max_station_distance_km_nullable` being `null` in the initial project configuration. This omission led to the failure in the ETL process, as the necessary configuration parameters were not correctly established."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the initial configuration for the project was not set correctly. In the ground truth action sequence, the `setProjectConfig` action specifies `forecast_horizon_days` as 7 and `max_station_distance_km_nullable` as 50.0. However, in the trajectory, the configuration tool is used with `forecast_horizon_days` and `max_station_distance_km_nullable` set to `null`, which means these parameters were not correctly set according to the user instruction and ground truth. This discrepancy in setting the configuration parameters is the functional difference leading to the fault."
