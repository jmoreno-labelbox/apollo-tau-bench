            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to correctly set the project configuration parameters, specifically the `forecast_horizon_days` and `max_station_distance_km_nullable`, which were left as `null` instead of being set to 7 and 50.0, respectively. Additionally, the agent did not correctly handle the geocoding for Portland, initially using incorrect coordinates for Seattle, and did not correct this error effectively. Furthermore, the agent did not set the weather forecast for Portland, which is a necessary step in the ground truth sequence. Lastly, the agent failed to record the file paths for the newly acquired raw data in the project's main file directory, which is a critical part of the task. These omissions and errors led to the failure in achieving the goal state as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

The correct coordinates for Portland should have been used (latitude: 45.5051, longitude: -122.6750) as indicated by the user. This error in using the wrong tool argument led to the retrieval of incorrect geocoding data and potentially affected subsequent actions that relied on accurate location data."
