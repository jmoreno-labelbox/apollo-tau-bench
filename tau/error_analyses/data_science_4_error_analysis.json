In the ground truth action sequence, the `setProjectConfig` action includes `forecast_horizon_days` set to 7 and `max_station_distance_km_nullable` set to 50.0. However, in the trajectory, these parameters are not set, as indicated by the `null` values in the project configuration response. This discrepancy means the agent did not fully configure the project as instructed."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `setProjectConfig` tool is called with the arguments `forecast_horizon_days` set to 7 and `max_station_distance_km_nullable` set to 50.0. However, in the trajectory, these arguments are not set (they are `null`), which means the tool was used with incorrect arguments, leading to a configuration that does not match the user's instruction."
