The agent repeatedly attempted to call this function with incorrect parameters, such as 'latitude', 'longitude', and 'horizon_days', which led to persistent errors. In the ground truth action sequence, the `setWeatherForecast` function is correctly invoked with the parameter 'city_name', which the agent failed to use. This discrepancy in parameter usage prevented the agent from successfully setting up the weather forecast, which is a crucial part of the project setup."

The incorrect use of arguments in the trajectory led to persistent errors and failure to set up the weather forecast data as required."
