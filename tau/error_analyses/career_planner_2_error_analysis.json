The environment returned errors indicating that the workflow was not found, which prevented the agent from proceeding with the necessary updates and actions outlined in the user instruction. Additionally, the environment failed to provide skill gap data and course suggestions, which were also available in the ground truth, further hindering the completion of the task."
