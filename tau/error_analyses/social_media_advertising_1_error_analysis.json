The ground truth specifies that the `AddAutomationRun` action should include the `run_id`, `run_type`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `status`, `input_ref`, and `errors_json` as arguments. However, in the trajectory, the `AddAutomationRun` tool was invoked without the required `reason` argument, leading to an error. This discrepancy indicates a \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault, as the tool was not used with the correct arguments as specified in the ground truth."
