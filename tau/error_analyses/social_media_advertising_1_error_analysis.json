The ground truth action sequence specifies the use of the `AddAutomationRun` action with specific parameters, including `input_ref` and `status`. However, in the trajectory, the agent encountered errors related to the `AddAutomationRun` action, indicating a failure to properly execute this step. Additionally, the agent did not attempt to suspend the 'Electronics - UK' ad set (ID 112) after confirming it was active, which was a required action according to the ground truth sequence."

The ground truth action sequence includes a successful logging of this automation run, but in the trajectory, the assistant encounters persistent errors and is unable to complete this action. This discrepancy indicates a failure to execute a required task as per the user instruction."
