This suggests that the environment is not correctly handling or processing the data types expected by the functions or methods being called. Additionally, there is an error indicating that the 'datetime' module is not defined, which implies that the necessary module was not imported or available in the environment, preventing the execution of time-related operations. These issues prevent the agent from executing the required actions to fulfill the user instruction."
