This suggests that the environment is not correctly handling or processing the data types, leading to repeated errors and preventing the execution of the intended actions. Additionally, there is an error indicating that 'datetime' is not defined, which suggests a missing import or configuration in the environment necessary for handling date operations. These issues prevent the agent from performing any of the actions outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
