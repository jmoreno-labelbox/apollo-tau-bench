The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `AddAutomationRun` tool should be invoked with the `input_ref` argument set to 'electronics_momentum' and does not require a 'reason' argument. However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to invoke `AddAutomationRun` without the correct arguments, leading to errors. The assistant incorrectly assumes a 'reason' argument is needed, which is not part of the ground truth specification, resulting in the \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
