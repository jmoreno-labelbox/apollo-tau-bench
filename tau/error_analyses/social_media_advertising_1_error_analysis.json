The ground truth action sequence includes logging a 'trend_analysis' automation run with specific parameters, but the agent encountered errors and did not complete this task. The agent's attempts to log the automation run resulted in repeated errors, indicating a failure to fulfill the user instruction to log the automation run with the input reference 'electronics_momentum'."

The ground truth specifies checking the status of the 'Electronics - UK' ad set with ID 112, but the trajectory attempted to check an ad set with ID '113', which resulted in an error. This discrepancy indicates the use of an incorrect tool argument."
