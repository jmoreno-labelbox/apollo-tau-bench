            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it provided incorrect percentage change calculations. The ground truth action sequence shows a single calculation of percentage change from August 7 to August 10, resulting in a 12.5% increase, which exceeds the 10% threshold. However, the trajectory incorrectly calculates the percentage change for each consecutive day, none of which exceed 10%. This discrepancy led to the incorrect conclusion that the growth did not exceed the 10% threshold, resulting in the decision not to suspend the 'Electronics - UK' ad set, which should have been suspended according to the ground truth."
