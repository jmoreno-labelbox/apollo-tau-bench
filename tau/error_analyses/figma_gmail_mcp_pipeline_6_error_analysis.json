Instead of performing actions such as creating a review cycle, exporting assets, creating a Gmail thread, and linking the cycle to the thread, the agent only provided email drafts and did not perform any functional operations to achieve the user's goal. Additionally, the agent included an incorrect recipient ('growth-team@company.com') in the email drafts, which was not part of the ground truth action sequence."

However, the trajectory only involves drafting an email without performing any of these actions, leaving the design review process incomplete."
