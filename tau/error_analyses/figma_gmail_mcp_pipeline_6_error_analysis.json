Specifically, the agent did not:\n1. Create a review cycle with the necessary identifiers and timestamps.\n2. Export the Figma artifact using the specified 'PNG 2x' export profile.\n3. Link the created Gmail thread to the review cycle.\n4. Append a message to the Gmail thread with the appropriate body and attachments.\n5. Update the governance tags for the artifact to include 'needs-review'.\n6. Record the automation run as completed.\n\nInstead, the agent only created a Gmail thread with an incorrect subject line ('Design/Needs-Review' instead of 'Design Review Request: 1 frames ready for review') and did not follow through with the other required actions."
