The agent did not perform any of the required actions such as creating a review cycle, exporting assets, creating a Gmail thread, linking the cycle to the thread, appending a Gmail message with the correct content and attachments, updating governance, or recording the automation run. Instead, the agent only provided email drafts and guidance, which did not fulfill the functional requirements of the task."

Specifically, the trajectory does not:\n\n1. **Create a Review Cycle**: The trajectory does not initiate a review cycle with the specified cycle ID, artifact ID, and recipients, which is a crucial step in the ground truth sequence.\n\n2. **Link the Email Thread to the Review Cycle**: The trajectory does not link the created email thread to the review cycle, which is necessary for tracking the review process.\n\n3. **Append the Email with the Correct Attachments**: The trajectory does not append the email with the 'PNG 2x' export of the Figma artifact as an attachment, which is required for the review.\n\n4. **Update Governance**: The trajectory does not update the governance tags for the artifact to include \"needs-review,\" which is part of the ground truth actions.\n\n5. **Record Automation Run**: The trajectory does not record the automation run for the review kickoff task, which is included in the ground truth sequence.\n\nThese omissions result in the goal being only partially completed, as the necessary steps to fully initiate and track the design review process are not executed."
