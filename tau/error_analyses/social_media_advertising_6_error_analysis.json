The ground truth action sequence involves retrieving adset details using `GetAdsetDetailsById` for specific adset IDs and then proceeding with actions like `FreezePlan`, `ApplyPlanAllocations`, `UpdatePlanStatus`, and `RecordAutomationRun`. However, the trajectory shows that the agent did not perform any of these actions and instead engaged in a prolonged conversation without taking any steps to fulfill the user's request."

However, in the trajectory, the assistant only engaged in a conversation with the user without performing any of these necessary actions, resulting in the plan not being prepared or applied."
