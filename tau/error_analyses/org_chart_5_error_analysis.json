This prevented the assistant from retrieving the user's profile and subsequently accessing Olivia Martinez's onboarding details, leading to an inability to perform the required actions. The ground truth action sequence does not require identity verification, indicating that the environment's setup for identity verification was unnecessary and improperly configured."
