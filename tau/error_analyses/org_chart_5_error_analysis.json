Instead of performing the actions to retrieve benefits enrollment, document compliance status, and compensation records for employee ID E10005, the agent incorrectly attempted to verify the identity of the user, which was not required according to the ground truth action sequence.

The ground truth action sequence does not include any steps for identity verification; it directly retrieves the necessary information using the employee ID provided in the user instruction. The assistant's insistence on identity verification prevents it from executing the required actions to fulfill the user instruction."
