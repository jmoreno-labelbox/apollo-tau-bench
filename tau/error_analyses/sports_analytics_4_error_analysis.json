Consequently, the agent attempted to proceed without these insights, leading to errors in generating the PDF report and other subsequent actions. The ground truth action sequence includes specific steps to gather and process pitcher data, which the agent did not execute, resulting in an incomplete and erroneous trajectory."

The error message \"Pdf.invoke() got an unexpected keyword argument 'insights'\" indicates that the tool was invoked with an incorrect argument. In the ground truth action sequence, the \"makePdf\" tool is correctly called with the argument \"insights\" set to \"flags_leverage\". However, in the trajectory, the tool was invoked with an incorrect or unexpected argument, leading to the error. This discrepancy in tool argument usage is the reason for the fault."
