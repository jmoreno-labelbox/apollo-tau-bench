Additionally, when attempting to submit the support ticket, the system encounters another error: \"SubmitSupportTicketTool.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'ticket_id',\" indicating a failure in handling the ticket submission due to a missing parameter. These technical issues in the environment prevent the completion of the tasks as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
