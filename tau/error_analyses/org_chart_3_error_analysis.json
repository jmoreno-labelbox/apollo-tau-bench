Instead, it mistakenly retrieved the details for Daniel Kim. The agent did not perform the necessary actions to remove the Dental Plan (BEN4002) from Michael Park's benefits, as specified in the user instruction. The agent also did not effectively handle the lack of an employee ID by using available information to search for the correct employee, leading to an inability to complete the task."

The ground truth action sequence correctly specifies filters with the first name \"Daniel\" and last name \"Kim\" to search for the employee, whereas the trajectory shows multiple errors due to missing or incorrect arguments for the `SearchEmployees` tool. This led to the assistant being unable to locate the correct employee record for Michael Park."
