The user instruction specified the employee's name as \"Michael Park,\" but the assistant incorrectly searched for \"Daniel Kim\" instead. This led to the assistant finding the wrong employee and proceeding with actions based on incorrect information. The ground truth action sequence correctly identifies the employee as \"Daniel Kim\" with the employee ID \"E10002,\" but the trajectory fails to use the correct filters for the employee search, resulting in a mismatch between the intended and executed actions."
