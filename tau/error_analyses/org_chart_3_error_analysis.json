Instead, it repeatedly attempted to invoke the `search_employees` function without providing the required 'filters' argument, resulting in errors. Additionally, the agent did not document the change as requested by the user, which was part of the instruction. The ground truth action sequence correctly identifies the employee as Daniel Kim (with the email michael.park@example.com) and updates the benefits, whereas the trajectory fails to perform these actions correctly."
