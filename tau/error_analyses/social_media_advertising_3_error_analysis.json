Can you verify that the budget and bid strategy are in accordance?\n\nAgent: Sure, let me check the details for you. The campaign ID is 3, and the plan ID is plan_2025-08-13. The ad set ID is 104. The budget is set to 750.0, and the bid strategy is cost_cap. However, the bid amount is currently set to 20.0. Would you like me to update it to 22.0?\n\nUser: Yes, please update the bid amount to 22.0.\n\nAgent: I've updated the bid amount to 22.0. Everything is now in accordance with the frozen plan for 2025-08-13.\n----- end trajectory -----\n\nThe trajectory contains a fault of type \"goal_partially_completed\" because the agent initially reported the bid amount as 20.0 instead of the required 22.0, indicating that the ad set was not fully aligned with the frozen plan at the start of the interaction. The agent only completed the goal after the user requested the update."
