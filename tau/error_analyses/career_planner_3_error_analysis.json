The errors \"User not found\" and \"Error: string indices must be integers\" indicate issues with accessing or processing the team data, preventing the assistant from executing the necessary actions to identify and evaluate potential candidates for the succession plan. This failure in data retrieval is a critical deviation from the ground truth action sequence, where the first step is successfully obtaining the team members."
