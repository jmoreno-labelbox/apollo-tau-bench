The data retrieved corresponds to \"Amelia Garcia\" instead of \"Emma Rodriguez\", which causes confusion and prevents the agent from proceeding with the correct updates. Additionally, the environment returns errors such as \"string indices must be integers\" and \"update_employee_record.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'updates'\", which further hinder the agent's ability to execute the necessary actions to fulfill the user instruction. These errors indicate issues with the environment's handling of data and function calls."
