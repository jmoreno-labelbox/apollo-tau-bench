The agent repeatedly attempted to use `find_employees.invoke()` without providing the required 'filters' argument, leading to a series of errors. This prevented the agent from executing the correct sequence of actions, starting with retrieving Emma Rodriguez's employee record using `GetEmployeeById`, which is essential for proceeding with the promotion and subsequent updates."
