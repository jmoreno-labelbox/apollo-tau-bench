The trajectory is empty, indicating that the environment did not execute any actions or facilitate any interaction between the user and the agent, which prevented the task from progressing. This lack of initialization or data provision is a functional difference from the ground truth action sequence, where specific actions were expected to be executed to achieve the goal."
