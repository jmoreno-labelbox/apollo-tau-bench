The errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicate that the environment is not providing the expected data structure or response format, preventing the agent from performing necessary actions like scanning incomplete tasks, executing file scans, or accessing log files. This discrepancy between the expected and actual environment responses leads to the agent's inability to follow through with the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
