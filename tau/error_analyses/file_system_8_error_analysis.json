Instead of performing the required operations such as scanning incomplete tasks, checking SSH connection, finding and statting files, filtering the file log, computing and verifying checksums, copying files to the host, performing remote cleanup, and updating the task status, the agent merely sent notifications to a \"File Check\" channel without executing any of the specified actions. This lack of action resulted in the failure to achieve the task's objectives as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
