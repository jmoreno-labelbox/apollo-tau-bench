Specifically, the agent did not successfully:\n\n1. Scan for incomplete tasks using `ScanIncompleteTasks`.\n2. Establish an SSH connection to the correct server address `server-prod-01.company.com` using `CheckSshConnection`.\n3. Execute the file scan with the correct parameters using `FindAndStatFiles`.\n4. Filter and verify the log file using `FilterFileLog`, `ComputeChecksum`, `CopyFileToHost`, and `VerifyLocalChecksum`.\n5. Perform remote cleanup using `RemoteCleanup`.\n6. Update the task status in the database using `UpdateTaskStatus`.\n7. Log the task completion using `LogTaskCompletion`.\n\nInstead, the agent encountered multiple errors related to accessing task details and executing actions, which prevented it from following the correct sequence of actions to achieve the task's goal."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `FindAndStatFiles` tool is used with the arguments `target_directory` and `last_access_days`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to use the `FindAndStatFiles` tool with an incorrect argument, `target_directory`, which results in an error: `FindAndStatFilesTool.invoke() got an unexpected keyword argument 'target_directory'`. This indicates that the tool was invoked with the wrong argument, leading to the failure of the action."
