            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to execute the initial action of scanning for incomplete tasks in the `file_check_db` using the `ScanIncompleteTasks` action. This action is crucial as it retrieves the necessary task details, including the server address and scan criteria, which are required for subsequent steps. Instead, the agent incorrectly requested the user to provide the server address and attempted to proceed without the necessary task details, leading to errors and an inability to perform the required operations."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the assistant attempted to use the `FindAndStatFiles` tool with an incorrect argument. The ground truth specifies that the `FindAndStatFiles` tool should be invoked with the arguments `target_directory` and `last_access_days`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant repeatedly encounters an error indicating that the `FindAndStatFilesTool.invoke()` received an unexpected keyword argument 'target_directory'. This suggests that the assistant did not correctly use the tool with the required arguments as specified in the ground truth action sequence."
