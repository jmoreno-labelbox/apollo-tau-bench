This prevented the agent from proceeding with the task processing as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the environment failed to locate the log files (\"file_check_log.json\" and \"scan_results.log\") and encountered errors when attempting to update the task's status in the database, further hindering the completion of the task. These issues indicate that the environment did not provide the necessary resources or access to execute the required actions successfully."
