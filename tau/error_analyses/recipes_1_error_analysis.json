These errors indicate that the environment lacks the necessary definitions or implementations for these functions or variables, which are crucial for executing the actions required to create and manage the grocery list. As a result, the agent is unable to proceed with the intended sequence of actions, leading to repeated errors and failure to achieve the goal state."
