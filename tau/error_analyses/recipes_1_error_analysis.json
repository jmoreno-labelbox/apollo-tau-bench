Specifically, the errors \"name '_json_dump' is not defined\" and \"_require() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given\" indicate that the environment is not correctly set up to handle JSON operations or function calls, which are necessary for executing the actions in the ground truth sequence. These errors prevent the successful execution of actions such as creating a grocery list and logging an audit event."
