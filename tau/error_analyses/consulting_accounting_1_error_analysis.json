The ground truth action sequence includes creating audit entries with a \"second_notice\" for both invoices, as they are overdue by more than 60 days. However, the trajectory shows that the agent encountered errors and did not perform these actions, resulting in a failure to document the necessary follow-up actions in the invoice audit trail."

Specifically, the trajectory incorrectly categorized the overdue days for invoices INV009 and INV021 into the \"61-90\" bucket, while the ground truth action sequence indicates that both invoices should have been categorized as \"Overdue >60 days\" and required a \"second_notice\" action. This discrepancy in categorization led to the wrong follow-up actions being prepared, which is a functional difference from the ground truth."
