The assistant should have created audit entries for these invoices with a 'second_notice' and the message 'Overdue >60 days', as they are overdue by more than 60 days. Instead, the trajectory shows repeated errors related to an incorrect attempt to use a 'dict' object, preventing the completion of the required actions. This results in the failure to document the follow-up actions in the invoice audit trail, as specified in the user instruction."
