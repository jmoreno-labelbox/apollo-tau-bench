The agent determined that both invoices were in the \"0-30 days\" bucket, with INV009 being 1 day overdue and INV021 being 16 days overdue. However, according to the ground truth, both invoices should have been classified as \"Overdue >60 days,\" requiring a \"second_notice\" action.

According to the ground truth, both invoices should have been classified as \"Overdue >60 days,\" requiring a 'second_notice' action. However, in the trajectory, the agent incorrectly computed the days overdue for INV009 as 1 day and for INV021 as 16 days, placing them in the \"0-30 days\" bucket. Consequently, no follow-up actions were taken, and no audit entries were created for these invoices, which partially completes the goal of handling the accounts receivable aging review."
