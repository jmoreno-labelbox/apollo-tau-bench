The agent should have computed the aging for invoices INV001, INV004, INV009, and INV021 using the date '2024-11-30' to determine their overdue status. Instead, the agent directly provided the overdue details without performing the necessary computations, which is a deviation from the ground truth action sequence."

The ground truth action sequence does not include any 'email_reminder' actions because the invoices INV009 and INV021 were both overdue by more than 60 days, requiring a 'second_notice'. However, the trajectory indicates that the agent only addressed invoices overdue by more than 60 days and did not check for or send reminders for any invoices that might have been overdue by 31 to 60 days, which is a necessary part of the task as per the user instruction. This omission means the goal was only partially completed."
