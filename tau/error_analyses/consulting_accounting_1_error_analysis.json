Specifically, the user calculated that INV009 is overdue by 61 days and INV021 by 76 days, but did not instruct the assistant to create audit entries for these invoices, which was required by the task. The user also did not provide the assistant with the necessary information to proceed with the follow-up actions, resulting in a lack of execution of the required actions."
