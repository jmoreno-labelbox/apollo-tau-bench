The agent determined that both invoices were in the \"0-30\" days overdue bucket, with INV009 being 1 day overdue and INV021 being 16 days overdue. However, according to the ground truth, both invoices should have been classified as \"Overdue >60 days,\" requiring a \"second_notice\" action. This misclassification led to the agent failing to create the necessary audit entries for these invoices, which was a required action in the ground truth sequence."

According to the ground truth action sequence, both invoices were overdue by more than 60 days and required a 'second_notice' with the message 'Overdue >60 days' to be recorded in the audit trail.
