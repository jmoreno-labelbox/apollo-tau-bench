The repeated error message `'dict' object has no attribute 'append'` indicates a malfunction in the environment's handling of the `CreateAuditEntry` function, preventing the creation of audit entries for invoices INV009 and INV021. This error is unrelated to the agent's logic or the user's instructions, as the agent correctly identified the need for these actions based on the invoice aging information."
