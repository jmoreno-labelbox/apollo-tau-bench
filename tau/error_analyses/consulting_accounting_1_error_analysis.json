This indicates a malfunction or misconfiguration in the environment's handling of the `GetInvoiceDetails` action, preventing the assistant from accessing the necessary invoice data to proceed with the task. As a result, the assistant is unable to perform any subsequent actions, such as computing invoice aging or creating audit entries, which are essential to fulfill the user instruction."
