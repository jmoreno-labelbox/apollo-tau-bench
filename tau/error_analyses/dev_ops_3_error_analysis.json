This suggests that the environment is incorrectly handling a string as if it were a dictionary or an object with a 'get' method, which prevents the execution of any actions. This error occurs before any actions from the ground truth sequence can be executed, indicating a fundamental issue in the environment's handling of the initial request or data structure."
