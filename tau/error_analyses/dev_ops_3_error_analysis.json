The agent encountered errors when attempting to use tools to get crash event details and find the work item by crash fingerprint, which are critical steps in the ground truth action sequence. These failures prevented the agent from progressing through the required actions to achieve the user's goal. Additionally, the agent did not attempt to resolve these errors or provide alternative solutions to complete the task."

Specifically, the assistant failed to use the correct arguments for the tools \"GetCrashEventDetails\" and \"FindWorkItemByCrashFingerprint\".

However, in the trajectory, the assistant did not provide these arguments correctly, leading to errors and failure to retrieve the necessary information."
