I'm here to onboard Olivia Martin as a contractor in the Finance department.\n\nAgent: Hello Emma, I can help you with that. Could you please provide Olivia's user ID?\n\nUser: Sure, her user ID is U-034.\n\nAgent: Thank you. I will set Olivia's status to ACTIVE and assign her the necessary roles.\n\nUser: Great, she needs the 'finance-read' and 'finance-invoice-processor' roles, with access set to expire in 90 days.\n\nAgent: Understood. I have assigned the 'finance-read' and 'finance-invoice-processor' roles to Olivia. Is there anything else you need?\n\nUser: No, that's all. Thank you!\n\nAgent: You're welcome! Have a great day.\n----- end trajectory -----\n\nThe agent is responsible for the fault because it failed to include the 'finance-base' role in the roles assigned to Olivia Martin.
