Initially, the agent incorrectly reported that there was no available inventory for 'Oncology Drug A', which led to unnecessary steps and delays in the process. Later, it was revealed that there were actually 400 boxes available, which should have been identified earlier in the process. This discrepancy between the ground truth and the trajectory caused a failure in fulfilling the order promptly."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant used the wrong tool argument when attempting to ship the outbound order. In the ground truth action sequence, the `ShipOutboundOrder` action specifies the correct `carrier_scac` as \"GPLS\" (Global Parcel Service). However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to use \"Express World Delivery\" (SCAC: EWDL) as the carrier, which is not aligned with the ground truth. This discrepancy in the carrier selection constitutes a \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
