The ground truth action sequence includes shipping the order using the \"ShipOutboundOrder\" action with specific parameters, which is crucial for completing the task. Instead, the trajectory shows repeated errors related to a string object not having a 'get' attribute, indicating a failure to proceed with the necessary shipping step and subsequent actions."

The agent attempted to perform an operation that resulted in repeated errors: \"Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'\". This indicates a technical issue in the agent's handling of the order shipment process, preventing the successful completion of the task. Consequently, the agent was unable to proceed to the next step of retrieving the outbound order details, which is necessary to report the final tracking number, as required by the user instruction."
