The agent did not proceed with shipping the order from the correct warehouse (WH-06) using the specified air carrier (GPLS) as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. Instead, the agent incorrectly attempted to transfer inventory to another warehouse (WH-05) and did not complete the shipping process, leading to a failure in fulfilling the user instruction. Additionally, the agent did not report the final tracking number after the shipment, which was a required step in the user instruction."

The tool was invoked with unexpected keyword arguments such as 'sku', 'quantity', and 'from_warehouse_id', which are not valid for this tool. This differs from the ground truth action sequence, where no warehouse transfer was needed because the correct warehouse (WH-06) already had sufficient inventory to fulfill the order. The assistant should have proceeded with creating and shipping the outbound order directly from the correct warehouse without attempting a transfer."
