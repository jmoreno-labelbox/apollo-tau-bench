This indicates a systemic issue with how the environment is processing requests, likely due to a misconfiguration or bug in the system that prevents it from recognizing and executing the intended actions. This error prevents the agent from performing any of the necessary steps to fulfill the user instruction, such as retrieving product details, listing warehouses, or creating and shipping the order."
