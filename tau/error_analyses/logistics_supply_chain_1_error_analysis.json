Instead of proceeding with the correct carrier \"Global Parcel Service\" (SCAC: GPLS) as per the ground truth, the agent attempted to use \"Desert Falcon Cargo\" (SCAC: DFC) for shipment, which was not part of the ground truth sequence. Additionally, the agent encountered repeated errors when trying to process the shipment, indicating a failure to correctly handle the order creation and shipping process. This deviation from the ground truth sequence led to the inability to complete the task and provide the final tracking number."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `ShipOutboundOrder` action is supposed to be invoked with specific arguments: `order_id`, `warehouse_id`, and `carrier_scac`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to proceed with shipping using Desert Falcon Cargo without specifying the correct `carrier_scac` (\"GPLS\") as per the ground truth. Instead, the assistant incorrectly attempts to use Desert Falcon Cargo, which is not aligned with the ground truth sequence. This discrepancy in the carrier selection and the lack of correct tool arguments for shipping led to the fault."
