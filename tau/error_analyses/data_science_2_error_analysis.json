Specifically, the agent did not perform the following actions from the ground truth sequence: `GetProjectConfigByCity`, `GetGeocodingResultByCity`, `GetStationsByLocation`, `GetPredictionsByModelName`, `GetMetricsByModelName`, and `AppendTerminalLogEntry` with the correct parameters. Instead, the agent attempted to retrieve weather forecasts and high-risk conditions, which were not part of the required protocol. Additionally, the agent failed to append the terminal log entry correctly, resulting in an error."

The ground truth specifies using the \"GetProjectConfigByCity\" and \"GetGeocodingResultByCity\" tools to gather information about Oakland, followed by other specific actions. However, the trajectory shows an attempt to retrieve a weather forecast for Oakland, which is not required by the user instruction or the ground truth action sequence. This constitutes a \"called_wrong_tool\" fault."
