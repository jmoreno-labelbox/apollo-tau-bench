This led to errors in retrieving predictions and metrics, which were not found, resulting in an incomplete status compilation for Oakland. Additionally, the terminal log entry was incorrectly labeled as \"status_compilation_oakland\" instead of \"status_compilation_san-francisco,\" and the printed timestamp was incorrect."

The trajectory uses the model name \"oakland_model\" instead of the correct \"simple_model\" as specified in the ground truth action sequence. This results in errors for predictions and metrics not being found, which deviates from the expected outcome where predictions and metrics should have been retrieved successfully using the \"simple_model\"."
