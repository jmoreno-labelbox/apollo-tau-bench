The ground truth action sequence specifies the use of the `GetProcessedTimeseriesSummary` tool with the CSV path `/data/processed/timeseries_sf_weather.csv`. However, in the trajectory, the agent incorrectly attempts to access non-existent CSV paths `/data/processed/oakland_weather_data.csv` and `/data/processed/san_francisco_weather_data.csv`, resulting in errors. This indicates that the agent called the wrong tool or used incorrect parameters for the task."
