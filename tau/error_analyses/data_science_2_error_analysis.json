Specifically, the agent did not perform the actions `GetPredictionsByModelName`, `GetMetricsByModelName`, and `AppendTerminalLogEntry`. Instead, it repeatedly executed the `GetProcessedTimeseriesSummary` action without progressing to the subsequent required actions, leading to an incomplete task execution."

The ground truth specifies using `query_latitude` and `query_longitude` as arguments, which are the geographic coordinates for Oakland. However, in the trajectory, the tool was used with `target_city` and other unrelated parameters, which do not align with the expected arguments for this tool. This discrepancy indicates the use of the wrong tool arguments."
