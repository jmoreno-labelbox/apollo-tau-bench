The error message indicates that the agent did not provide the required `article_id_override` argument when invoking the `RegisterNewArticle` function. This argument was necessary to register the article with the specified ID 'art_f1a2', as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The repeated errors suggest that the agent did not handle the missing argument properly, leading to a failure in registering the article and proceeding with subsequent actions."
