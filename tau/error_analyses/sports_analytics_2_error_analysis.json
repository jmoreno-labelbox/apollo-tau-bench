Specifically, the agent encountered errors when attempting to invoke the `GeneratePdfReport` action due to incorrect arguments and failed to handle the subsequent errors related to appending to a dictionary. Additionally, the agent did not perform the required actions such as `WriteCuratedInsight`, `WriteReportArtifacts`, `WriteVideoPlaylist`, `WriteWorkflowRun`, `PostToSlack`, and `WriteIngestionLog`, which are essential for completing the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

This discrepancy in the argument leads to an error, indicating the use of a wrong tool argument."
