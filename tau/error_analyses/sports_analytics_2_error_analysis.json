The trajectory ends with repeated errors indicating that a 'dict' object has no attribute 'append', which suggests a malfunction in handling the data structure or an incorrect attempt to append to a dictionary. This prevented the completion of the required actions such as generating the PDF report, writing report artifacts, and posting to Slack, which are present in the ground truth action sequence."
