Specifically, the errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\", \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", and \"name '_load_table' is not defined\" indicate that the environment did not properly handle the data structures or provide the necessary functions for the agent to execute the required actions. These errors prevented the agent from retrieving probable pitchers, processing data, and writing curated insights, which are essential steps in the ground truth action sequence."
