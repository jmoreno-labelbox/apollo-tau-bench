            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault because it failed to correctly execute the `WriteCuratedInsight` actions for pitcher ID 101. The agent encountered an error due to a missing required positional argument, `supporting_stat_value`, when attempting to invoke `WriteCuratedInsight`. This prevented the agent from writing the curated insights to the database, which is a critical step in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent did not handle the absence of probable pitchers correctly, as it should have continued with the process using the provided pitcher IDs and insights."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `GeneratePdfReport` tool is invoked with the correct arguments, including 'insights' set to \"flags_leverage\", 'game_pk', and 'report_type'. The trajectory's attempt to use 'insights' as an argument led to an error, indicating a misuse of the tool's expected parameters."
