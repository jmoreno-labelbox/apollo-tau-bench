This error prevented the agent from performing any of the required actions to generate the pre-series scouting package, such as computing key metrics, filtering insights, writing curated insights, generating reports, and logging the workflow. As a result, the agent was unable to progress beyond the initial setup phase, leading to a complete breakdown in the action sequence."
