Now, create a secure directory at '/secure/quarantine/config_review_20240120/' to quarantine these files.\n\nUser: The directory is created. I've moved the files there.\n\nAgent: Excellent. How many files did you move?\n\nUser: I moved 2 files.\n\nAgent: Perfect. Now, update the database to reflect the moved file statuses.\n\nUser: Database updated.\n\nAgent: Good job. Finally, document the successful quarantine process.\n\nUser: Documentation is complete.\n\nAgent: All set. Let me know if you need anything else.\n----- end trajectory -----\n\nThe trajectory contains a fault because the agent failed to ensure that a \"quarantine_task_logged\" and a \"slack_alert_sent\" were completed, which are part of the required outputs."
