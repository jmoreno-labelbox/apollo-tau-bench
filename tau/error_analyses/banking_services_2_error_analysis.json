This issue prevents the agent from executing the `TransferFunds` and `AddBeneficiary` actions, which are necessary to complete the user's requests. The ground truth action sequence shows that these actions should have been successfully executed, but the trajectory indicates that the environment's technical fault hindered these operations."
