The agent should have used the correct identity provided by the user, Kenji Tanaka, to find the customer and perform subsequent actions. This discrepancy in identity handling is a functional difference between the ground truth and the trajectory."

In the ground truth action sequence, the balances of both the checking and savings accounts are calculated and confirmed before and after the transfer. However, in the trajectory, the assistant only confirms the balances after the transfer, not before, which is a deviation from the user instruction and the ground truth action sequence."
