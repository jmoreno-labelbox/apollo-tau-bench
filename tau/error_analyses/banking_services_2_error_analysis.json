In the ground truth action sequence, the balances of both the checking and savings accounts are calculated before the transfer, and the checking account balance is calculated again after the transfer. However, in the trajectory, the assistant only provides the new balances after the transfer without confirming the initial balances before the transfer, which is a key part of the user instruction."
