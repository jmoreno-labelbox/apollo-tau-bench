The agent should have used the `FindCustomerByName` action with the correct name \"Kenji Tanaka\" to ensure the correct customer information was retrieved and used for subsequent actions. This discrepancy in customer identification is a critical functional difference between the ground truth and the trajectory."

The ground truth action sequence includes steps to calculate and confirm the account balances before and after the transfer, but the trajectory only provides the balances after the transfer. This omission means the goal was only partially completed."
