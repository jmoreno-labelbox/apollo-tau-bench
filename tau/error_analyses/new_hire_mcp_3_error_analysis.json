This resulted in errors and prevented the completion of these tasks. The agent also failed to record the terminal log due to missing the 'candidate_id' argument and an incorrect use of the 'datetime' module. These issues indicate a lack of proper handling of required parameters and error management, leading to incomplete task execution compared to the ground truth action sequence."

This discrepancy in the argument name led to an error in the tool invocation."
