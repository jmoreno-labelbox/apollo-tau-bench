Specifically, the agent did not update the asset requests, checklist item, onboarding file, or candidate record with the correct status updates. The agent also did not apply the label to the email correctly. Instead, the agent logged events and provided confirmations without actually performing the necessary updates or applying the label, which are critical steps in the ground truth action sequence."

Specifically, when tagging the email, the trajectory uses `\"updated_label_id\": \"Ready\"` in one of the tool actions, which is not a valid argument for the `ApplyLabelToEmail` action. The correct argument should have been `\"label_id\": \"label_Ready\"`, as indicated in the ground truth action sequence. This discrepancy in the tool argument leads to the fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\"."
