Specifically:\n\n1. The trajectory involves approving asset requests `req_201` and `req_202` for candidate `cand_2`, whereas the ground truth specifies approving asset requests `req_501` and `req_502` for candidate `cand_5`.\n\n2.

The trajectory involves finalizing checklist `check_201`, whereas the ground truth specifies finalizing checklist `check_502`.\n\n4. The trajectory involves checking the onboarding file `offer_letter.pdf`, whereas the ground truth specifies checking the file `files/Benefits-Guide.pdf`.\n\n5. The trajectory involves tagging email `email_201` with 'Ready', whereas the ground truth specifies tagging email `email_502` with 'label_Ready'.\n\n6. The trajectory involves updating candidate `cand_2`, whereas the ground truth specifies updating candidate `cand_5`.\n\nThese discrepancies indicate that the wrong tool arguments were used in the trajectory compared to the ground truth."
