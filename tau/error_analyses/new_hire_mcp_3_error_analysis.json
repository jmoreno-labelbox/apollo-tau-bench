The agent did not update the asset requests, checklist items, onboarding file, or candidate record with the correct status updates. Additionally, the agent did not apply the correct label to the email or record the terminal logs with the correct candidate ID. The actions performed by the agent were incomplete and did not match the required updates and logging specified in the ground truth."

Specifically:\n\n1. The `UpdateAssetRequest` actions in the trajectory used request IDs `req_201` and `req_202`, whereas the ground truth used `req_501` and `req_502`.\n2. The `AssignAsset` actions in the trajectory used asset tags `LT-002` and `PH-002` for candidate `cand_2`, whereas the ground truth used `LT-005B` and `PH-005B` for candidate `cand_5`.\n3. The `UpdateChecklistItem` action in the trajectory used checklist item ID `check_201`, whereas the ground truth used `check_502`.\n4. The `UpdateOnboardingFile` action in the trajectory used the file path `offer_letter.pdf`, whereas the ground truth used `files/Benefits-Guide.pdf`.\n5. The `ApplyLabelToEmail` action in the trajectory used email ID `email_201`, whereas the ground truth used `email_502`.\n\nThese discrepancies indicate that the wrong tool arguments were used in the trajectory compared to the ground truth."
