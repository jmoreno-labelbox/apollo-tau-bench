The ground truth action sequence specifies different request IDs, asset tags, checklist item, onboarding file, email ID, and candidate ID than those used in the trajectory. The agent should have used the correct identifiers provided in the user instruction to perform the actions accurately. Additionally, the agent did not properly update the candidate record with the correct candidate ID and status updates as required."

Specifically:\n\n1. The trajectory uses request IDs \"req_201\" and \"req_202\" for the `UpdateAssetRequest` actions, whereas the ground truth uses \"req_501\" and \"req_502\".\n2. The trajectory uses asset tags \"LT-002\" and \"PH-002\" for the `AssignAsset` actions, whereas the ground truth uses \"LT-005B\" and \"PH-005B\".\n3. The trajectory uses checklist item ID \"check_201\" for the `UpdateChecklistItem` action, whereas the ground truth uses \"check_502\".\n4. The trajectory uses the file path \"offer_letter.pdf\" for the `UpdateOnboardingFile` action, whereas the ground truth uses \"files/Benefits-Guide.pdf\".\n5. The trajectory uses email ID \"email_201\" for the `ApplyLabelToEmail` action, whereas the ground truth uses \"email_502\".\n\nThese discrepancies indicate that the wrong tool arguments were used in the trajectory compared to the ground truth."
