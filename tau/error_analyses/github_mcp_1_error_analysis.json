Instead, the agent incorrectly guided the user to perform these actions manually, which deviates from the expected automated process.

Specifically, the agent did not successfully authenticate the user, create a new branch, add the new file, commit the changes, create a pull request, approve the pull request, merge the branch, mark the pull request as merged, or delete the branch. Instead, the user had to manually update the file, create the pull request, and merge it. The agent's guidance was incomplete and did not automate these steps as expected, leading to only partial completion of the goal."
