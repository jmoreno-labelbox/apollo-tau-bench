Instead, the agent provided instructions for the user to perform these actions manually, which deviates from the ground truth action sequence where the agent should have automated these tasks. Additionally, the agent did not authenticate the user or perform any actions directly on the repository, which are critical steps outlined in the ground truth."

The assistant attempted to create a branch named `add-contributing-guidelines` instead of the correct branch name `feature-branch` as specified in the user instruction and ground truth action sequence. This led to an error because the branch `add-contributing-guidelines` already existed, and the assistant did not proceed with creating the correct branch `feature-branch`."
