            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to execute the `CalculateCumulativeImpact` action correctly. The agent encountered repeated errors due to missing the required positional argument 'from_date' and incorrectly attempting to use `datetime.now()`, which led to multiple errors and prevented the calculation of the total budget impact as specified in the ground truth action sequence. This failure resulted in the agent not providing the correct cumulative impact analysis, which was a crucial part of the user instruction."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is due to the incorrect use of the `ValidateChangeCompliance` tool. The ground truth specifies that the compliance check for `cr_001` should include verifying multiple compliance criteria: `has_business_justification`, `has_impact_assessment`, `proper_approval_sequence`, `baseline_exists`, and `critical_path_risk_assessed`. However, in the trajectory, the tool was invoked twice with only partial checks: first for `business_justification` and `impact_assessment`, and then separately for `proper_approval_sequence`, `baseline_exists`, and `critical_path_risk_assessed`. This indicates a misuse of tool arguments, as the compliance check should have been performed in a single invocation with all criteria included."
