This indicates a technical issue with the environment's handling of the agent's requests, preventing the agent from executing the necessary actions to retrieve and process the required information. As a result, the agent is unable to perform any of the steps outlined in the ground truth action sequence, such as searching for change requests, validating compliance, checking for conflicts, saving conflicts, and calculating the cumulative impact."
