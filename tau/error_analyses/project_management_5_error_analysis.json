This error prevented the retrieval of change requests from the project, which is a critical step in the process. Additionally, there were repeated errors related to the `datetime` module, which affected the ability to retrieve compliance details and calculate the budget impact. These technical issues in the environment led to the failure in executing the necessary actions as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
