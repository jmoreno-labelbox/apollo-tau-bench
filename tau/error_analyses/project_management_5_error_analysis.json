This led to multiple errors and the incorrect conclusion that there were no change requests meeting the criteria.\n\n2. **SaveChangeRequestsConflicts Errors**: The agent encountered errors when attempting to save conflict details due to incorrect invocation of the `SaveChangeRequestsConflicts` action. The agent used an unexpected keyword argument `conflict_severity` and missed the required `conflicting_deliverables` argument.\n\n3. **CalculateCumulativeImpact Invocation Errors**: The agent failed to correctly invoke the `CalculateCumulativeImpact` action due to missing the required `from_date` argument. Additionally, the agent encountered repeated errors related to the incorrect use of the `datetime` module, which prevented the calculation of the total budget impact.\n\nThese errors indicate that the agent did not follow the correct sequence of actions and failed to handle the required parameters, leading to an incomplete and incorrect execution of the task."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the `SearchChangeRequests` tool was invoked without the correct arguments. The ground truth specifies that the tool should be called with `project_id` set to \"proj_mobile_01\" and `include_impact` set to `true`. However, in the trajectory, the tool was invoked multiple times with missing required arguments such as 'change_type', 'priority', 'requester_id', and 'status', which are not part of the ground truth action sequence. This discrepancy in the tool invocation arguments led to errors and the failure to retrieve the necessary change requests."
