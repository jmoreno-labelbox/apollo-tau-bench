This resulted in an empty trajectory, meaning no actions were taken to execute the required steps outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The environment did not allow the agent to perform any of the necessary actions such as searching for change requests, validating compliance, checking for conflicts, saving conflict details, or calculating the cumulative impact, which are all crucial to achieving the task's objectives."
