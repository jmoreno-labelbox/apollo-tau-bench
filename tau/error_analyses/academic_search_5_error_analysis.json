The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `FindUsers` tool should be called with the argument `name: \"Dr. Sarah Johnson\"`. However, in the trajectory, the `FindUsers` tool was invoked repeatedly without providing the required `name` argument, leading to errors indicating missing arguments such as 'research_field' and 'user_id'. This incorrect usage of tool arguments caused the failure in executing the intended actions."
