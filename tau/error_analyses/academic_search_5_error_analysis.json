The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `FindUsers` tool should be called with the argument `name` set to \"Dr. Sarah Johnson\". However, in the trajectory, the `FindUsers` tool was repeatedly invoked with missing arguments, specifically the `name` and `user_id` arguments, leading to errors. The correct invocation should have included the `name` argument to successfully find the user."
