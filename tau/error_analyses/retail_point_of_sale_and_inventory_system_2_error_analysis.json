Specifically, the agent repeatedly used the customer ID \"CUST-5012\" instead of \"CUST-5001\" when trying to update the email and phone number. This resulted in the system returning details for a different customer, Logan Smith, instead of the intended customer, Emma Wilson. The correct customer ID \"CUST-5001\" should have been used for these updates, as specified in the ground truth action sequence."
