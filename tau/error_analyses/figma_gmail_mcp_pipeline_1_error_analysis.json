Specifically, the tool was called with an unexpected keyword argument 'subject' and was missing the required positional argument 'workflow_type'. In the ground truth action sequence, the `CreateGmailThread` tool is correctly invoked with the 'workflow_type' argument set to \"review\", and no 'subject' argument is used. This discrepancy in the arguments led to repeated errors in the trajectory."
