The trajectory attempts to invoke `CreateGmailThread` with an unexpected keyword argument 'subject' and repeatedly fails to provide the required positional argument 'workflow_type'. In the ground truth action sequence, `CreateGmailThread` is correctly invoked with the 'workflow_type' argument set to \"review\", which is missing in the trajectory. This discrepancy in tool arguments leads to the failure in creating the email thread as intended."
