This prevented the assistant from locating the Figma artifacts tagged with 'needs-review', which is a crucial step in the process outlined in the ground truth action sequence. As a result, the subsequent steps that depend on the successful filtering of artifacts could not be executed, leading to a breakdown in the workflow."
