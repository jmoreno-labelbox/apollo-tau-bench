The agent repeatedly encountered errors due to missing arguments when attempting to retrieve the paper and researcher profiles. The agent did not correctly use the \"RetrievePapers\" and \"FindResearcherProfiles\" actions with the appropriate parameters, which prevented it from obtaining the necessary article ID and author user ID. Consequently, the agent was unable to proceed with creating the submission, assigning the reviewer, and updating the submission status as required by the user instruction."

The ground truth action sequence shows that `RetrievePapers` should be invoked with the `title` argument, and `FindResearcherProfiles` should be invoked with the `name` argument. However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempted to use additional or incorrect arguments such as `article_id`, `topic`, `year`, `author_name`, `research_field`, and `user_id`, which led to errors and prevented the successful execution of the required actions."
