            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to several issues:\n\n1. **Incorrect Invocation of Tools**: The agent repeatedly invoked tools with missing required arguments, such as `CreateSubmission`, `RetrievePapers`, `FindResearcherProfiles`, and `SearchSubmissions`. This indicates a failure to properly construct the necessary parameters for these actions.\n\n2. **Failure to Assign Reviewer**: The agent failed to assign 'Prof. James Wilson' as a reviewer due to not retrieving his profile correctly. The ground truth sequence successfully finds the researcher's profile and assigns him as a reviewer, which the agent did not accomplish.\n\n3. **Submission Status Update**: The agent did not update the submission status to 'under_review', as required by the user instruction. The ground truth sequence includes this step, but the agent failed to execute it due to errors in recognizing the submission.\n\n4. **Inability to Search Submissions**: The agent failed to search for the submission details due to missing arguments, which prevented it from verifying or correcting any issues with the submission.\n\nOverall, the agent's inability to correctly execute the necessary actions and handle errors led to the failure in achieving the user's goal."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the assistant incorrectly handled the arguments for the tools. Specifically, the assistant failed to provide the correct arguments for the `RetrievePapers`, `CreateSubmission`, `FindResearcherProfiles`, and `SearchSubmissions` tools. For example, the `RetrievePapers` tool was invoked without the required arguments 'article_id', 'topic', and 'year', and the `CreateSubmission` tool was invoked without the 'submission_id_override'. Additionally, the `FindResearcherProfiles` tool was repeatedly invoked without the necessary 'user_id' argument. These errors in argument handling prevented the assistant from successfully executing the actions needed to process the article and manage the submission as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
