The agent did not correctly invoke the `RetrievePapers` and `FindResearcherProfiles` actions with the required parameters, leading to errors. Consequently, it could not proceed with creating the submission, assigning the reviewer, or updating the submission status as specified in the ground truth action sequence. The agent's inability to handle missing information and its failure to guide the user effectively resulted in the failure to achieve the task."

The ground truth action sequence specifies that `RetrievePapers` should be invoked with the `title` argument, and `FindResearcherProfiles` should be invoked with the `name` argument. However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to use `RetrievePapers` and `FindResearcherProfiles` with incorrect or missing arguments, leading to errors. This discrepancy in tool argument usage is the reason for the \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
