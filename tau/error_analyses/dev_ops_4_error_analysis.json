This action is necessary to monitor the triage status and mark it as 'in_progress', as specified in the user instruction. The absence of this action in the trajectory led to the failure to complete the automation run and update its status correctly, which is a significant deviation from the ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth, the `AttachSymbolicatedStackToRun` action is supposed to attach the symbolicated stack to the run using the `build_id` \"build_001\", `module_name` \"GameEngine.dll\", and `platform` \"windows\". However, in the trajectory, the assistant incorrectly retrieves the symbol information using the `GetSymbolDetails` tool with the wrong argument, resulting in a PDB URI that does not match the expected symbolicated stack URI from the ground truth. The correct action should have directly attached the symbolicated stack to the run without retrieving the symbol details separately."
