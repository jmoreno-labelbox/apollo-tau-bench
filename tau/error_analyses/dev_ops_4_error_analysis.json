Specifically, the agent did not:\n\n1. Start the automation run with the specified automation run ID.\n2. Attach the symbolicated stack to the run.\n3. Complete the automation run with the required status and outputs.\n4. Retrieve the updated build run details after setting the triage status.\n\nThese actions are crucial for fulfilling the user instruction, and their absence indicates a failure to follow the deterministic steps outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

The assistant attempted to use an `owner_id` argument, which is not part of the ground truth action sequence. In the ground truth, the `SetBuildTriageStatus` action only requires the `run_id` and `triage_status` arguments. The trajectory incorrectly included an additional `owner_id` argument, which led to an error."
