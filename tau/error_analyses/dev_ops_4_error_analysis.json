Specifically, the errors \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"name '_idx_by_id' is not defined\" indicate issues with the environment's handling of the tool's functions or data structures. These errors prevented the successful execution of actions such as attaching the symbolicated stack, logging the build command, fetching ownership details, and updating the triage status, which are all necessary steps outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The environment's inability to process these actions correctly led to the failure in achieving the desired outcomes."
