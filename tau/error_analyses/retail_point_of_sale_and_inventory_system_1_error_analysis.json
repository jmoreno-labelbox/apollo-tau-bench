The errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"name 'datetime' is not defined\" indicate that there are underlying problems with the environment's ability to process requests and execute the necessary functions. These issues prevent the agent from activating the promotion, retrieving active promotions, checking product details, and updating the promotion details, which are all required actions according to the ground truth action sequence."
