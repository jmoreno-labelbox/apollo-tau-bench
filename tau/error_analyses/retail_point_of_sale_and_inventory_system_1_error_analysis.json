This initial error likely disrupted the execution of subsequent actions, leading to repeated errors \"'str' object has no attribute 'get',\" suggesting that the environment was attempting to access attributes or methods on a string object that were not applicable, possibly due to incorrect handling of data types or responses. These errors prevented the execution of the intended actions in the ground truth action sequence."
