The agent attempted to update the `times_used` field for `PROMO-001` but encountered an error due to an unexpected keyword argument. In the ground truth action sequence, the `UpdatePromotionDetails` action is successfully executed with the correct parameters, including `promotion_id` and `times_used`. The agent should have ensured that the action was invoked with the correct parameters to update the `times_used` count to 10 as instructed."

The assistant attempted to update the `times_used` field directly, which resulted in an error because the tool does not accept `times_used` as a valid argument. In the ground truth action sequence, the `UpdatePromotionDetails` tool is correctly used with `promotion_id` and `times_used` as arguments, indicating that the tool should have been able to handle this update if used correctly. The trajectory failed to perform this action as intended, leading to the fault."
