The ground truth action sequence specifies updating the `times_used` count for `PROMO-001` to 10, but the agent encountered an error and incorrectly concluded that the `times_used` field cannot be updated directly. This discrepancy between the expected action and the agent's response led to the fault in the trajectory."

The ground truth action sequence specifies using the `UpdatePromotionDetails` tool with the argument `times_used: 10`, but the trajectory shows an error indicating that 'times_used' is not a valid argument for this tool. This discrepancy indicates that the assistant used the wrong tool argument, leading to the failure in updating the promotion details as intended."
