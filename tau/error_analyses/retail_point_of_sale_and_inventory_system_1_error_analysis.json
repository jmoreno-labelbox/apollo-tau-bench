The agent incorrectly reported an error when attempting to update the 'times_used' count for the promotion, stating that the `times_used` argument was unexpected. However, the ground truth action sequence indicates that updating the 'times_used' count is a valid action, and the agent should have executed it without error."

The assistant attempted to update the 'times_used' count for the promotion using an incorrect argument. The ground truth action sequence specifies using the `UpdatePromotionDetails` tool with the argument `times_used: 10`, but the trajectory shows an error indicating that 'times_used' is not a valid argument for the tool. This discrepancy indicates that the assistant used the wrong tool argument, leading to the failure in updating the promotion details as intended."
