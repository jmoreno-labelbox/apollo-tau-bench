Instead, the agent incorrectly assumed that the promotion was already active and did not attempt to activate it. Additionally, the agent encountered an error when trying to update the 'times_used' count for the promotion, indicating a misunderstanding or misconfiguration of the \"UpdatePromotionDetails\" action, which should have been executed with the correct parameters. These discrepancies led to the agent not following the ground truth action sequence accurately."

The ground truth action sequence specifies updating the `times_used` count for `PROMO-001` to 10 using the `UpdatePromotionDetails` tool with the correct argument `times_used`. However, in the trajectory, the tool invocation results in an error because the `times_used` argument is not recognized, indicating that the tool was used with an incorrect or unsupported argument."
