            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to execute the `ActivatePromotion` action for the promotion 'PROMO-001'. Instead, the agent incorrectly assumed the promotion was already active without verifying or activating it. Additionally, the agent encountered an error when attempting to update the `times_used` count for the promotion, indicating a misunderstanding of the system's capabilities or an incorrect implementation of the `UpdatePromotionDetails` action. These discrepancies led to the failure to follow the correct sequence of actions as outlined in the ground truth."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is that the `UpdatePromotionDetails` action was attempted with an incorrect argument. The ground truth specifies updating the `times_used` count for `PROMO-001` using the `UpdatePromotionDetails` action with the argument `times_used: 10`. However, in the trajectory, the system returned an error indicating that `UpdatePromotionDetails.invoke()` received an unexpected keyword argument 'times_used'. This suggests that the tool was used with an incorrect or unsupported argument, leading to the failure of the intended action."
