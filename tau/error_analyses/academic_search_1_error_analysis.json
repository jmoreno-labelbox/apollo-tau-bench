The agent repeatedly encountered errors due to missing parameters when attempting to use the `SearchProjects` and `SearchArticles` tools, and it did not resolve these issues or attempt alternative methods to gather the required information. Consequently, the agent did not perform any of the actions in the ground truth sequence, such as searching for citations, analyzing citation details, or creating a log entry, which were essential to fulfill the user instruction."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `SearchProjects` tool is correctly invoked with the `project_name` argument, which is sufficient for the task. The assistant's failure to provide the correct arguments prevents it from retrieving the necessary project details and proceeding with the audit as instructed."
