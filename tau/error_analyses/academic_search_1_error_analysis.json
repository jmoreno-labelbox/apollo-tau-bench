The agent encountered errors due to missing required arguments in the `SearchProjects` and `SearchArticles` functions and did not attempt to correct these errors or provide alternative solutions. As a result, the agent did not perform any of the actions in the ground truth sequence, such as searching for the project, retrieving citation details, or creating a log entry. This led to the agent being unable to verify the cross-disciplinary impact of the project, which was the user's goal."

Specifically, the assistant repeatedly attempted to invoke the `SearchProjects` and `SearchArticles` tools without providing the necessary arguments, such as 'funding_source_id' for `SearchProjects` and multiple required parameters for `SearchArticles`. This resulted in errors and prevented the assistant from retrieving the necessary project and article information to proceed with the audit, which is a functional deviation from the ground truth action sequence where these tools were used correctly with the appropriate arguments."
