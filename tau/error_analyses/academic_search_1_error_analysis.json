The agent repeatedly attempted to use the `SearchArticles` tool without providing the required parameters, resulting in errors. The ground truth action sequence shows that the agent should have used the `SearchProjects` and `SearchCitations` tools to find the relevant citations and determine the cross-disciplinary impact, followed by creating a log entry. The agent did not follow this sequence and instead got stuck in a loop of errors due to missing parameters, failing to progress towards the goal."

In the ground truth action sequence, the correct tool `SearchProjects` is used first to identify the project, followed by `SearchCitations` and `GetCitationDetails` to find and verify the cross-disciplinary impact. The trajectory fails to follow this sequence and instead incorrectly attempts to use `SearchArticles` without the required parameters, leading to errors and an inability to progress towards the goal."
