This prevented the agent from proceeding with the subsequent steps necessary to verify the cross-disciplinary impact, as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The agent did not successfully retrieve or analyze any citations, nor did it create or return the required log entry, leading to a failure in achieving the task's goal."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `SearchProjects` tool is correctly invoked with the `project_name` argument specified as \"Quantum Computing Applications\". This discrepancy prevented the assistant from retrieving the necessary project information and proceeding with the audit as instructed."
