The agent did not include the required arguments such as 'funding_source_id' for `SearchProjects` and various parameters like 'article_id', 'author_name', 'title', etc., for `SearchArticles`. This resulted in errors and prevented the agent from successfully identifying the core article and its most recent citation, which was necessary to verify the cross-disciplinary impact as per the user instruction."

The ground truth action sequence specifies using `SearchProjects` with the `project_name` argument to find the project \"Quantum Computing Applications\" and then using `SearchCitations` and `GetCitationDetails` to analyze citations. However, in the trajectory, the assistant repeatedly attempts to use `SearchProjects` and `SearchArticles` without providing the necessary arguments, such as `funding_source_id` for `SearchProjects` and various required parameters for `SearchArticles`. This results in errors and prevents the assistant from correctly identifying and analyzing the most recent citation, leading to a failure in executing the task as intended."
