The assistant attempted to use this tool without providing the required argument `owner_email` initially, which led to an error. In the ground truth action sequence, the `GetAllArtifactsOfTypeWithTagsAndEmail` tool is correctly used with the `owner_email` argument set to \"emma.creative@company.com\". This discrepancy in the use of tool arguments is the reason for the fault."
