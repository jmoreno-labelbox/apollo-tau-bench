Specifically, the agent did not attempt to retrieve the frame artifacts using the correct parameters, such as the \"needs-review\" tag, and did not proceed with creating the asset, starting the email thread, or updating the cycle status as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. Instead, the agent repeatedly asked for information that was not required according to the ground truth, leading to an incomplete task execution."
