Instead, the agent asked the user for information that was not required, such as the Figma File ID, and did not attempt to fetch the artifact using the available owner email and tags. This led to an inability to create the asset and attach it to the email, resulting in an incomplete task."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `StartEmailThread` action includes the `attachments_asset_ids` argument with the value `[\"asset_019\"]`, which is necessary to attach the asset to the email thread. The trajectory failed to create the asset and thus could not provide this argument, leading to an error."
