The agent encountered an error due to missing the required 'updates' argument when attempting to update the shipment details. This error was repeated multiple times, indicating that the agent did not properly handle the update process as specified in the ground truth action sequence. In the ground truth, the `UpdateInboundShipment` action was successfully executed with the correct updates provided, whereas in the trajectory, the agent failed to provide the necessary updates, resulting in an error."

The assistant attempted to update the shipment with the carrier name and SCAC both set to \"DFC\", which is incorrect. The correct carrier name should have been \"Global Parcel Service\" with the SCAC \"GPLS\", as per the ground truth action sequence. This discrepancy indicates the use of the wrong tool argument for updating the shipment details."
