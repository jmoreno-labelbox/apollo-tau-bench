However, both \"DFC\" and \"GPLS\" had the same rating and on-time delivery percentage, and the ground truth sequence chose \"GPLS\" as the replacement carrier. The agent failed to follow this decision-making process and incorrectly selected \"DFC\" instead."

The user decided to select \"DFC\" as the alternative carrier, but the assistant incorrectly updated the shipment with \"DFC\" instead of \"GPLS\". According to the ground truth, \"GPLS\" should have been selected as the alternative carrier because it has the same top rating as \"DFC\" but was chosen based on the superior on-time delivery percentage or other criteria not explicitly mentioned in the trajectory. This discrepancy indicates the use of the wrong tool argument in the trajectory."
