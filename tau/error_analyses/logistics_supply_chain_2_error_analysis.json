Specifically, the errors \"string indices must be integers\" and \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicate that the environment did not provide the expected data structure or response format, preventing the agent from executing the necessary actions to verify the carrier's operational status and potentially update the shipment with an alternative carrier. This discrepancy between the expected and actual environment responses led to the failure in completing the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
