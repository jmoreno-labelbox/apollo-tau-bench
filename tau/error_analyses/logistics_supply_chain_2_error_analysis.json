The agent attempted to invoke the `UpdateInboundShipment` tool multiple times but encountered an error due to a missing required positional argument, 'updates'. This prevented the shipment details from being updated with the new carrier, DFC, as specified in the user instruction and ground truth action sequence. The ground truth action sequence successfully updates the shipment with the new carrier details, whereas the trajectory fails to do so due to the repeated invocation errors."

In the ground truth action sequence, the \"UpdateInboundShipment\" action includes the 'updates' argument with the new carrier details, specifically the 'carrier_name' and 'carrier_scac'. The trajectory, however, shows repeated errors due to the missing 'updates' argument, indicating that the agent did not correctly specify the necessary information to update the shipment with the new carrier details."
