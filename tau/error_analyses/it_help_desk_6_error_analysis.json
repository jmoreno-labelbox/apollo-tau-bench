This error prevented the agent from successfully retrieving the RBAC baseline for the role, which is a critical step in the onboarding process. As a result, the agent was unable to proceed with the subsequent actions required to complete the onboarding process as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

The error message indicates that the function `_find_one()` received an unexpected keyword argument 'department'. In the ground truth, the `GetBaselineForRole` action is correctly called with the arguments `department` and `job_title`, but in the trajectory, the assistant's tool call fails repeatedly due to the incorrect use of the 'department' argument, which is not recognized by the function being called."
