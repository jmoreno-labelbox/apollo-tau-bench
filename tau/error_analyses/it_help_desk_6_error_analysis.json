Specifically, the environment fails to retrieve the RBAC baseline, employee records, license capacity, and asset information, which are crucial for proceeding with the onboarding process. These errors result in the inability to perform actions such as aligning RBAC, assigning licenses, provisioning assets, and setting up app accounts, leading to a halt in the onboarding process."
