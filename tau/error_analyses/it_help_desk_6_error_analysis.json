This prevented the onboarding process from proceeding as planned. Additionally, attempts to retrieve the baseline RBAC for the Marketing Content Strategist role also failed due to an unexpected keyword argument error in the system. These errors indicate that the environment's system was not functioning correctly, preventing the execution of necessary actions in the onboarding process."
