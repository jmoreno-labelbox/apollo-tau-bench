In the ground truth, the `template_code` should be \"client_onboarding\", but in the trajectory, it was incorrectly set to \"welcome_template\". Additionally, for the `SendEmail` action for client 6, the `broker_id` was incorrectly set to 2 instead of 1. These discrepancies indicate the use of incorrect arguments in the tool invocation."
