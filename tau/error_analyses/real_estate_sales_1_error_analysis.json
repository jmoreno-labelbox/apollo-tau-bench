In the ground truth, the \"broker_id\" for all actions involving clients 4, 5, and 6 should be 1. However, in the trajectory, the \"broker_id\" for client 6 was incorrectly set to 2 in both the \"SendEmail\" and \"CreateCalendarEvent\" actions. This discrepancy indicates the use of the wrong tool argument for the \"broker_id\" parameter."
