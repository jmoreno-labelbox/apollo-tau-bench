The assistant repeatedly attempted to search for these clients but was unable to find them in the system, which prevented the assistant from proceeding with the onboarding tasks such as sending welcome communications and organizing consultations. This lack of access to client data is a critical difference from the ground truth action sequence, where the clients were successfully found and onboarded."
