Specifically, the agent did not perform the following actions:\n\n1. **SearchClients**: The agent did not successfully search for clients 4, 5, and 6, which is a crucial step to verify their existence and proceed with onboarding.\n\n2. **GetListingDetails** and **GetComparableProperties**: The agent did not retrieve the listing details or comparable properties for property HTX003, which are necessary for providing comprehensive onboarding services.\n\n3. **CreateCampaign**: The agent did not create the \"Premium Client Onboarding \u2014 Elite Segment\" campaign, which is required for the onboarding process.\n\nThese omissions led to an incomplete onboarding process, as the agent did not gather all necessary information and set up the required campaign, which are critical steps outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth action sequence, the \"template_code\" should be \"client_onboarding\", but in the trajectory, the assistant used \"Premium Real Estate Services\" as the \"template_code\". This discrepancy indicates the use of an incorrect tool argument, leading to the fault type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\"."
