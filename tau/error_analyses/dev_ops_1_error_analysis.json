The agent did not perform any of the required actions such as receiving the CI event, attaching run artifacts, extracting failure signals, or any subsequent steps leading to the creation of a draft PR. Instead, the agent repeatedly encountered errors and failed to progress beyond the initial steps, resulting in a lack of functional actions to address the CI pipeline issue."

The assistant does not perform any of the necessary steps such as receiving the CI event, attaching run artifacts, extracting failure signals, or any subsequent actions needed to address the CI failure. Instead, the assistant engages in a prolonged conversation with the user without taking any concrete actions to resolve the issue, which deviates from the expected automated process outlined in the ground truth."
