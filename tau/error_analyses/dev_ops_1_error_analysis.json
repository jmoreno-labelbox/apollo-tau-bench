This error prevents the agent from executing the necessary steps to handle the CI triage, such as receiving the CI event, extracting failure signals, and proposing a fix patch, which are all part of the ground truth action sequence. The environment's inability to process these actions correctly leads to the agent being unable to proceed with the task as instructed."
