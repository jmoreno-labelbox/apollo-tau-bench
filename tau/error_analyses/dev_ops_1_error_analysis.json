These errors prevent the agent from executing the necessary actions to process the CI event, extract failure signals, and perform subsequent steps such as proposing a fix patch, opening a draft pull request, and recording automation runs. The environment's inability to provide the required functionality and data access leads to the agent's failure to complete the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
