This error prevents the agent from retrieving necessary information about the CI event, which is crucial for proceeding with the triage process. The ground truth action sequence involves successfully receiving the CI event and processing it, but the trajectory shows that the environment fails to handle the CI event due to the persistent error, leading to the inability to perform any subsequent actions."
