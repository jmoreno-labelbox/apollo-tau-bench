This error prevented the successful completion of the following actions: QuarantineInventory, PerformPhysicalCount, CreateInventoryAdjustment, CreateIncidentReport, NotifySupplier, and CalculateFinancialImpact. As a result, the agent was unable to perform these actions, which are part of the ground truth action sequence, leading to the fault in the trajectory."
