Specifically, the errors related to undefined functions such as 'get_current_timestamp' and 'get_current_year_month_day' caused failures in executing the \"QuarantineInventory,\" \"CreateInventoryAdjustment,\" \"CreateIncidentReport,\" \"NotifySupplier,\" and \"CalculateFinancialImpact\" actions. These errors indicate a problem with the environment's ability to handle date and time functions, which are likely necessary for these actions to be completed successfully. As a result, the agent was unable to perform these actions, deviating from the ground truth action sequence."
