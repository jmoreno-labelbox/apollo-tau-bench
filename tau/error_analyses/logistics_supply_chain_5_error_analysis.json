These actions include placing the inventory in quarantine, performing a physical inventory count, creating an incident report, notifying the supplier, and calculating the financial impact. Additionally, there was an error \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" when attempting to check the notification status and incident ID. These system errors hindered the agent from executing the necessary actions as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
