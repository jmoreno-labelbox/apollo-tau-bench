The agent encounters multiple errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", which prevent it from executing the necessary actions to finalize the purchase. These errors indicate issues with the agent's code or logic, which are not present in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth sequence successfully retrieves the contact information, lists products, reserves a cart ID, creates a cart, adds items to the cart, and completes the order without encountering such errors."
