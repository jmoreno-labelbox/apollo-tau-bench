The user instruction was about finalizing a purchase of two units of a Wireless Mouse from CAT103, but the trajectory involves tasks related to reviewing and exporting design artifacts, which is unrelated to the user's goal. This mismatch in context led to the trajectory not addressing the user's actual instruction."
