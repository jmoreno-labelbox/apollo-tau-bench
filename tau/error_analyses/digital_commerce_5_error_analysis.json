Specifically, the errors \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\" indicate that there were issues with the system's handling of data structures, preventing the retrieval of contact information and the creation of a cart. These errors are not related to the agent's logic but rather to the environment's inability to process the actions correctly, leading to the failure in completing the purchase process as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
