The error message \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicates a technical issue in the environment's handling of the `GetContactByEmail` action, preventing the agent from proceeding with creating a cart and completing the order process. This issue is not present in the ground truth action sequence, where the contact information is successfully retrieved, allowing the subsequent actions to be executed without errors."
