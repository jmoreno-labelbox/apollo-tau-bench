The system returned errors such as \"Order not found\" and \"Product not found\" for valid order IDs and product IDs, which prevented the agent from executing the required actions to complete the audit tasks. This indicates a malfunction or data access issue within the environment that hindered the agent's ability to perform the instructed actions."
