Specifically, the `export_assets.invoke()` function fails due to an unexpected keyword argument 'artifact_id', and subsequent errors indicate a persistent issue with the definition or handling of 'kwargs'. These errors prevent the successful execution of the required actions to export the asset, update governance, create the email thread, append the message, and record the automation run, as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
