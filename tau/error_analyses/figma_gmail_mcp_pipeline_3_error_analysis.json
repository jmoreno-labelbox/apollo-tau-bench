Specifically, the errors \"name '_export_ext_from_profile' is not defined\" and \"name '_ensure' is not defined\" indicate that there are missing or undefined functions or variables in the environment that are necessary for exporting the asset and creating the Gmail thread. These errors prevented the successful completion of the \"ExportAssets\" and \"CreateGmailThread\" actions, which are crucial steps in the ground truth action sequence. As a result, the agent was unable to proceed with the tasks as intended."
