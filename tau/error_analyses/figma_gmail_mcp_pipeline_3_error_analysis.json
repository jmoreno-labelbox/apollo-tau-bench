This prevented the subsequent actions from being executed, as the initial export of the asset was not completed. The agent also repeatedly encountered a \"name 'kwargs' is not defined\" error, indicating a failure in handling the parameters required for the actions. As a result, the email for the design review was not created or sent, and the asset was not tagged for review, deviating from the ground truth action sequence."

The ground truth action sequence specifies the use of the argument `artifact_id`, but the trajectory shows an error indicating that `export_assets.invoke()` received an unexpected keyword argument 'artifact_id'. This suggests that the tool was called with an incorrect or unsupported argument, leading to the failure in executing the action."
