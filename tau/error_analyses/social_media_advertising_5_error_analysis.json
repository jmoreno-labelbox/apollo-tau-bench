The ground truth action sequence includes creating and updating automation runs with specific IDs and timeframes (AR-20250815-01, AR-20250815-02, and AR-20250815-03) for the plan freeze, budget application, and strategy application, respectively. However, the trajectory shows that the agent logged incorrect run IDs and timeframes (AR-20250814-01, AR-20250814-02, and AR-20250814-03) and failed to correct these entries or create new ones as requested by the user. Additionally, the agent encountered errors when attempting to log new entries, indicating a failure to execute the required actions."

The ground truth specifies that the run IDs should be AR-20250815-01, AR-20250815-02, and AR-20250815-03, with specific timeframes on August 15, 2025.

This discrepancy indicates that the wrong arguments were used when creating the audit trail entries."
