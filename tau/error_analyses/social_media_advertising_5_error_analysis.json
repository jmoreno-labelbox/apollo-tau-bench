Specifically, the budget change was logged at \"2025-08-13T02:15:00Z\" instead of within the required window of \"2025-08-15T02:10:00Z\u201302:12:00Z\". Additionally, the bid amount update was also logged at \"2025-08-13T02:15:00Z\" instead of within the window \"2025-08-15T02:15:00Z\u201302:16:00Z\". Furthermore, the agent did not create the necessary automation runs (AR-20250815-01, AR-20250815-02, and AR-20250815-03) with the correct timestamps and input references, which are crucial for maintaining the audit trail as per the instruction."

In the ground truth, the \"UpdateAdsetBudget\" action should have been executed with \"updated_at\": \"2025-08-15T02:10:00Z\", and the \"UpdateAdsetBidStrategy\" action with \"updated_at\": \"2025-08-15T02:15:00Z\".
