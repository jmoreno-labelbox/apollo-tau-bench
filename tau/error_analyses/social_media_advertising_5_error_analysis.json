Specifically, the agent encountered errors when attempting to document the automation runs for AR-20250815-01, AR-20250815-02, and AR-20250815-03, which are necessary to comply with the user instruction. These errors prevented the completion of the audit trail, which is a critical part of the task. Additionally, the agent incorrectly updated the bid amount at the same time as the budget change, instead of at the specified later time."

In the ground truth, the bid amount was supposed to be updated to $35.00 effective from \"2025-08-15T02:15:00Z\". However, in the trajectory, the bid amount was updated to $35.00 effective from \"2025-08-15T02:10:00Z\", which is incorrect according to the user instruction. This discrepancy in the timing of the bid amount update constitutes the fault."
