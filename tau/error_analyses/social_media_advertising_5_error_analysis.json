Specifically, the errors \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\" indicate that the environment is not handling the data types correctly, preventing the agent from executing the necessary actions to retrieve the plan details, update the ad set budget and bid strategy, and log the changes as required by the user instruction. This malfunction in the environment's handling of data types disrupts the agent's ability to perform the tasks outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
