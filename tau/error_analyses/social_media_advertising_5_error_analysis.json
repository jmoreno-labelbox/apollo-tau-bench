Specifically, the agent encountered errors when attempting to log the \"plan_freeze,\" \"budget_apply,\" and \"strategy_apply\" automation runs, which are crucial for maintaining an accurate audit trail as per the user instruction. The ground truth action sequence includes these steps, but the trajectory shows repeated errors ('dict' object has no attribute 'append') that prevented these actions from being completed. This discrepancy led to an incomplete audit trail, which is a critical part of the task."

Specifically, the assistant encounters persistent errors when attempting to log the \"plan_freeze,\" \"budget_apply,\" and \"strategy_apply\" automation runs.
