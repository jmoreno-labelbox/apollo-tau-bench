This prevented the archive from being created and transferred as specified in the user instruction. Additionally, the agent failed to log the completion message and notify the 'System Alerts' channel, as it encountered the same error when attempting these actions. These failures led to the user having to manually handle parts of the task, deviating from the ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth, the source path for the transfer is specified as `\"/tmp/archives/prod_logs_backup.tar.gz\"`, but in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to transfer the file using an incorrect or incomplete path, leading to errors such as \"Source file not found: prod_logs_backup\". This indicates that the assistant did not use the correct file path argument for the transfer operation."
