The agent encountered persistent errors related to the internal handling of file paths, specifically the error \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", which prevented the creation of the archive. This failure led to the inability to proceed with subsequent actions such as transferring the archive, deleting the original log files, and logging the completion message, all of which are necessary to achieve the task's goal."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant attempted to create an archive using incorrect arguments, leading to repeated errors. The ground truth specifies using the `CreateArchive` action with specific parameters, including `user_id`, `destination_directory`, `remote_address`, `archive_name`, and `filepaths`. However, the trajectory shows the assistant failing to execute this action correctly, resulting in errors like \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", indicating a misuse of tool arguments or an incorrect method of handling the file paths. This discrepancy between the expected and actual tool usage constitutes a \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
