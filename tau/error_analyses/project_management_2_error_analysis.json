            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to the absence of completed sprints for `team_mobile_01`, which resulted in the inability to retrieve velocity statistics. This discrepancy led to the agent's failure to execute the `GetTeamVelocity` action for `team_mobile_01` as expected in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the environment returned an error indicating that the sprint 'team_mobile_01' was not found, which further hindered the agent's ability to proceed with the planned actions. These issues prevented the agent from following the correct sequence of actions to achieve the user's goals."
