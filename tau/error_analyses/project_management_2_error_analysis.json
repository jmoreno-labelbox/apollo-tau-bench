            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to provide the necessary data for the `GetTeamVelocity` action for `team_mobile_01`, returning \"No completed sprints found for this team\" instead of the expected velocity data. This discrepancy led to the agent's inability to proceed with the correct actions, such as calculating team capacity and planning the sprint effectively. Additionally, the environment returned errors for the `CreateSprint` and `GetBacklogTasks` actions due to missing arguments, which further hindered the agent's ability to execute the required tasks. These issues prevented the agent from following the ground truth action sequence accurately."
