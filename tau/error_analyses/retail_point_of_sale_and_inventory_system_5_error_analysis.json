            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to several functional differences from the ground truth action sequence:\n\n1. **Incorrect Invocation of Functions**: The agent repeatedly attempted to invoke functions without providing the required arguments, such as `store_id` for `GetStoreInfo`, `ListStoreSKUs`, `ListActivePromotions`, and `GetProductInfo`. This led to errors and prevented the agent from retrieving necessary information.\n\n2. **Failure to Retrieve and Use Employee Information**: The agent did not successfully retrieve the employee information using `GetEmployeeInfo`, which was necessary for logging the audit result accurately.\n\n3. **Incomplete Logging of Audit Result**: The agent failed to log the audit result correctly initially due to missing required arguments (`auditor_id`, `sku`, and `store_id`). This was only corrected after the user provided additional information.\n\n4. **Lack of Sequential Action Execution**: The agent did not follow the correct sequence of actions as outlined in the ground truth, such as listing active promotions and applying the bulk discount in the correct order.\n\nThese issues resulted in the agent's inability to perform the task as specified in the user instruction and ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `LogAuditResult` action should include the parameters `timestamp`, `photo`, and `digital_signature` with specific values: `\"timestamp\": \"2025-09-01T13:45:00Z\"`, `\"photo\": \"compliance001.jpg\"`, and `\"digital_signature\": \"SIG-COMP-001\"`. However, in the trajectory, these parameters are missing, and the result logged is `\"discrepancy_logged\"` instead of the expected detailed documentation. This discrepancy indicates the use of incorrect or incomplete arguments for the `LogAuditResult` tool."
