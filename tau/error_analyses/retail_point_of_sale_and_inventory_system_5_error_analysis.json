The agent incorrectly determined that there were no expired products based on the last stock count date, which is not the correct method for identifying expired products. The ground truth action sequence specifies using the \"FlagExpiredProducts\" action with the \"as_of_date\" parameter to identify expired products, which the agent did not perform. This led to the incorrect conclusion that there were no expired products, affecting subsequent actions such as applying a clearance discount and verifying clearance against inventory levels."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `LogAuditResult` action should include the `timestamp`, `photo`, and `digital_signature` as arguments, but in the trajectory, the `result` was incorrectly set to \"discrepancy_logged\" instead of including the correct arguments. This discrepancy indicates a misuse of tool arguments, leading to the fault type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\"."
