This step was crucial and was not successfully completed.\n\n2. **Incorrect Handling of Errors**: The agent did not effectively handle the errors encountered during the retrieval of promotions, leading to a lack of resolution or corrective action to obtain the necessary information.\n\n3. **Incomplete Documentation of Compliance Review**: The agent failed to correctly log the audit result initially, as indicated by the error message about missing required positional arguments. Although it eventually logged the audit result, the process was not smooth and lacked the necessary steps to ensure all required information was included from the start.\n\nThese issues demonstrate a lack of adherence to the ground truth action sequence, resulting in an incomplete and faulty execution of the task."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is due to the incorrect use of the `ListActivePromotions` tool. The assistant attempted to invoke `ListActivePromotions` without providing the required `store_id` argument, which led to an error. In the ground truth action sequence, `ListActivePromotions` is correctly invoked with both `store_id` and `sku` as arguments. This discrepancy in tool usage is the reason for the \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
