The agent encountered multiple errors, such as missing required arguments and undefined functions, which prevented it from obtaining the necessary sensor data. Consequently, the agent could not proceed with the subsequent actions, such as scheduling the AC and curtain adjustments, setting up the daily routine, and establishing the reminder, as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

This results in errors and prevents the agent from successfully retrieving the temperature from the living-room thermometer, which is the first step in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent encounters an undefined function '_find', further indicating incorrect tool usage."
