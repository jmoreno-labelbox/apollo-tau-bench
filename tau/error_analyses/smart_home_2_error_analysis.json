            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The initial attempt to query the sensors failed because the `QueryEntities.invoke()` method was missing a required positional argument, 'filters'. This indicates a problem with how the environment handles the query for entities, as it should have been able to process the request with the correct parameters.\n\n2. Subsequent attempts to interact with the environment resulted in repeated errors stating that the name '_find' is not defined. This suggests a persistent issue in the environment's code or configuration, preventing the agent from retrieving the necessary information about the living-room thermometer.\n\nThese errors in the environment prevented the agent from executing the necessary actions to check the temperature and proceed with the subsequent tasks outlined in the user instruction."
