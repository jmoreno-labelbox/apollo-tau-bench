The errors indicate that the agent did not provide the required `update` parameter when invoking the `ModifyDeviceState` function, leading to repeated errors and failure to schedule the devices as instructed. This contrasts with the ground truth action sequence, where the `ModifyDeviceState` actions are correctly executed with the necessary parameters."

The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `ModifyDeviceState` action should include an `update` dictionary with specific parameters for the device state change, such as `power`, `mode`, `setpoint_c`, and `fan_speed` for the AC. The errors in the trajectory indicate that these parameters were not correctly provided, leading to repeated invocation errors."
