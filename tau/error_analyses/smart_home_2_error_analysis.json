The error message \"ModifyDeviceState.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'update'\" indicates that the agent did not provide the necessary 'update' parameter when attempting to modify the device state. This prevented the agent from setting the AC to the specified configuration and scheduling it to activate at 13:00, as required by the user instruction. Additionally, the agent did not proceed with the subsequent actions, such as scheduling the curtain closure, setting up the daily routine for the lights, and establishing the reminder, due to the repeated errors."

The error message \"ModifyDeviceState.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'update'\" indicates that the `update` argument, which specifies the changes to be made to the device state, was not provided correctly. In the ground truth, the `ModifyDeviceState` action includes an `update` dictionary with specific parameters for the AC, such as `power`, `mode`, `setpoint_c`, and `fan_speed`. The trajectory failed to provide this `update` argument, leading to the error."
