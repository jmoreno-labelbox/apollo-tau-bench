The ground truth specifies setting `power=on`, `mode=cool`, `setpoint_c=22`, and `fan_speed=auto`, but the trajectory only scheduled `mode=cool`.\n\n2. **Curtain Scheduling**: The agent incorrectly scheduled the curtain to close with `position=100` instead of `position=0` as required by the instruction.\n\n3. **Ceiling Light Routine**: The agent incorrectly scheduled the ceiling light to turn off instead of on with a brightness of 30 at 19:00.\n\n4. **Reminder Setup**: The agent failed to establish the one-time reminder due to multiple errors in invoking the `UpsertReminder` function, resulting in the reminder not being set up at all."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is due to the incorrect use of the `ModifyDeviceState` tool for scheduling the central AC. The ground truth specifies that the AC should be scheduled with the parameters `power=on`, `mode=cool`, `setpoint_c=22`, and `fan_speed=auto`. However, in the trajectory, the AC was only scheduled with `mode=cool`, missing the other required parameters (`power`, `setpoint_c`, and `fan_speed`). This discrepancy indicates the use of the wrong tool argument, as the complete set of parameters was not provided as specified in the ground truth."
