This indicates a failure to correctly format the action to modify the AC's state with the required parameters (power, mode, setpoint_c, fan_speed).\n\n2. **Curtain Scheduling Error**: The agent scheduled the curtain to close at 13:00 but set the position to 100 instead of 0, which is incorrect as per the user instruction.\n\n3. **Daily Routine Setup Error**: The agent repeatedly encountered an error (`'str' object has no attribute 'get'`) when attempting to set up the daily routine for the ceiling light and floor lamp. This indicates a failure to correctly execute the action to modify the device states with the required parameters (power and brightness for the ceiling light, power for the floor lamp).\n\nThese errors prevented the agent from successfully completing the tasks as specified in the user instruction."
