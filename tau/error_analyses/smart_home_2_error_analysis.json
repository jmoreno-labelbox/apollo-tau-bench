The `ModifyDeviceState` action for the AC was not executed properly due to a missing argument error, resulting in the AC not being set with the specified parameters (mode, setpoint, fan speed).\n\n2. **Curtain Position Error**: The agent scheduled the curtain to close at the wrong position. The ground truth specifies the curtain should be set to position 0, but the agent set it to position 100.\n\n3. **Lighting Routine Error**: The agent incorrectly set the daily routine for the lights. The ground truth specifies turning on the ceiling light with brightness 30 and turning off the floor lamp. However, the agent scheduled both lights to turn off.\n\n4. **Reminder Setup Error**: The agent failed to set up the one-time reminder due to multiple errors related to incorrect arguments and missing parameters, resulting in the reminder not being created."

The ground truth specifies that the `update` should include `power`, `mode`, `setpoint_c`, and `fan_speed`, but the trajectory only attempted to set `power` to \"on\". Additionally, the `ModifyDeviceState` action for the living-room curtain was scheduled with the wrong `position` value of 100 instead of 0, which is required to close the curtain."
