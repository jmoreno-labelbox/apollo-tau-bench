The agent encountered errors and only managed to schedule the AC in cool mode without setting the temperature and fan speed correctly.\n\n2. **Daily Routine Setup Error**: The agent failed to set up the daily routine for the ceiling light and floor lamp at 19:00. The agent encountered repeated errors ('str' object has no attribute 'get') and did not successfully schedule the ceiling light to turn on with brightness=30 and the floor lamp to turn off.\n\nThese errors indicate that the agent did not execute the required actions as specified in the ground truth action sequence."

The ground truth specifies that the AC should be scheduled with `power=on`, `mode=cool`, `setpoint_c=22`, and `fan_speed=auto`. However, the trajectory shows repeated errors indicating that the parameters used were not allowed for the device, and ultimately, only `mode=cool` was successfully scheduled, without setting the `power`, `setpoint_c`, or `fan_speed` as required."
