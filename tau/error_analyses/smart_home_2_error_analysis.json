The agent encountered repeated errors ('str' object has no attribute 'get') when attempting to schedule the ceiling light to turn on with brightness set to 30 and the floor lamp to turn off at 19:00 daily. This resulted in the failure to complete the task as specified in the user instruction and the ground truth action sequence."

Specifically, the assistant encountered an error: `ModifyDeviceState.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'update'`, indicating that the `update` argument was not correctly passed to the tool. This error occurred when trying to schedule the central AC, which is a deviation from the ground truth action sequence where the `update` argument was correctly provided with the necessary parameters for the AC configuration."
