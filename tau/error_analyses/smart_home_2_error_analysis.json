The agent encountered errors and only managed to schedule the power and mode, but not the setpoint and fan speed.\n\n2. **Reminder Setup**: The agent failed to set up the one-time reminder titled \"Close windows before AC starts\" at 12:55 PM. The agent encountered multiple errors related to incorrect handling of the reminder parameters, such as unexpected keyword arguments and missing required arguments.\n\nThese issues indicate that the agent did not execute the required actions as specified in the ground truth action sequence."

The assistant attempted to use the `UpsertReminder` tool with incorrect arguments, such as 'reminder_id' and 'title', which are not valid according to the ground truth action sequence. The correct usage should have included a single 'reminder' argument containing a dictionary with all necessary details, including 'reminder_id', 'target', 'trigger', 'actions', 'status', and 'meta'. This discrepancy led to errors and the failure to set up the reminder as instructed."
