This indicates a malfunction in the environment's handling of the agent's requests, preventing the agent from executing the necessary actions to fulfill the user instruction. Additionally, the initial error \"QueryEntities.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'filters'\" suggests that the environment's API is not correctly processing the agent's queries, leading to a failure in retrieving the necessary sensor data. These errors in the environment prevent the agent from progressing beyond the initial steps of the task."
