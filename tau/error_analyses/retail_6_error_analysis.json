This indicates a technical issue with the environment's handling of tool requests, preventing the assistant from executing any of the required actions such as recording tracking events, scheduling delivery, processing payments, or updating order status. This persistent error is unrelated to the assistant's logic or the user's input, and it prevents the completion of the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
