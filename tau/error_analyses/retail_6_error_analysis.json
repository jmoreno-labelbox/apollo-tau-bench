This error prevented the agent from executing several actions, including recording the 'received' scan, scheduling the delivery, inputting the 'out_for_delivery' scan, posting the payment, and tagging the order. The error indicates a technical issue in the environment's handling of the tool's responses, which should have been structured data but were instead treated as strings, leading to the failure of the expected operations."
