The error message \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicates a malfunction in the environment's handling of tool actions, preventing the assistant from performing necessary operations such as recording tracking events, scheduling delivery, processing payments, and adding order tags. This issue is unrelated to the assistant's logic or the user's input, as the assistant correctly attempted to execute the required actions based on the user's instructions."
