This prevents the agent from executing any actions, including allocating a tracking ID, splitting the order fulfillment, appending tracking events, scheduling delivery, adding order payment, adding order tags, and updating the order status, which are all necessary steps outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The environment's failure to define or provide access to the '_find_order' function results in the agent being unable to proceed with the task."
