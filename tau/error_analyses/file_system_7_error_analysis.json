Instead, it logged the task with an incorrect task ID \"move_logs\" and task name \"Move /var/log to /processed/logs\". This deviation from the ground truth action sequence led to a failure in meeting the specific audit requirements outlined in the user instruction. Additionally, the agent did not attempt to log the final task completion or send the required Slack notification, which are critical steps in the ground truth sequence."
