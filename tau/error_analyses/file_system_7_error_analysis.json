Specifically, the `ParseDirectoryRestructureInstructionsTool` and `LogTaskCompletionTool` are throwing errors due to unexpected keyword arguments, and the `CreateFileListForMove` tool is encountering an attribute error. These tool errors prevent the assistant from executing the necessary actions to reorganize the files and log the task completion, which are critical steps outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
