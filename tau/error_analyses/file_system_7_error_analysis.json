The agent encountered persistent errors when attempting to generate the file list and compute destination paths, but did not resolve these issues or take alternative actions to complete the task. Additionally, the agent did not log the task completion with the specified note or send the required notification to `#ops-alerts`, both of which are critical for meeting the compliance audit requirements. The ground truth action sequence includes these steps, but the agent did not perform them, resulting in an incomplete task."
