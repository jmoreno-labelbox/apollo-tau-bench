The agent encountered errors with the `LogTaskCompletion` tool due to incorrect keyword arguments, which prevented it from logging the initial note 'Registering plan: Move /var/log to /processed/logs.' and the final note 'Reorganized 3 files from /var/log to /processed/logs after successful pre-flight checks.' These logs are critical for the automated compliance check, and their absence means the task does not meet the specified audit requirements. Additionally, the agent did not successfully parse the directory restructure instructions due to tool invocation errors, which further contributed to the failure in executing the task as per the ground truth action sequence."

This mismatch in argument names led to repeated errors and prevented the successful execution of the intended actions."
