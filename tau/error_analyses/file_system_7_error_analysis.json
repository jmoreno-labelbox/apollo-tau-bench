The agent encountered persistent errors and did not successfully create a file list, verify space requirements, or move the files. Additionally, the agent did not log the task completion with the required note or send the specified notification to `#ops-alerts`. These steps are crucial for meeting the compliance audit requirements outlined in the user instruction."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is that the assistant used the wrong tool argument when logging the initial plan. In the ground truth, the `LogTaskCompletion` action logs the plan with the `task_id`, `task_name`, `result`, and `notes` fields, specifically noting \"Registering plan: Move /var/log to /processed/logs.\" However, in the trajectory, the assistant logs the plan using a tool with the `channel` argument set to \"File Check\" instead of using the correct fields as specified in the ground truth. This discrepancy in the tool argument leads to a failure in meeting the audit trail requirements."
