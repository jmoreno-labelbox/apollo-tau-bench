The ground truth required specific notes for the initial and final logs, but the agent encountered errors and did not log these entries as specified.\n\n2. **Notification Message**: The agent sent an incorrect message to the `#ops-alerts` channel. The ground truth required a specific message format, but the agent's message did not match the required format.\n\n3. **Execution Errors**: The agent repeatedly encountered errors with tool invocations, such as `ParseDirectoryRestructureInstructionsTool` and `LogTaskCompletionTool`, which prevented the correct execution of actions.\n\nThese discrepancies between the ground truth and the trajectory indicate that the agent did not fulfill the task requirements as specified in the user instruction."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the `ParseDirectoryRestructureInstructions` tool was invoked with an incorrect argument. In the ground truth, the `ParseDirectoryRestructureInstructions` tool is called with the arguments `target_directory`, `destination_directory`, and `sort_rules`. However, in the trajectory, the tool invocation fails with an error indicating an unexpected keyword argument 'target_directory', suggesting that the tool was not used correctly with the expected arguments. This discrepancy in tool usage leads to the failure in parsing the directory restructure instructions, which is a critical step in the process."
