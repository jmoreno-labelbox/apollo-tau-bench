The initial log entry should have been \"Registering plan: Move /var/log to /processed/logs.\" but the agent logged \"Intending to move files from /var/log to /processed/logs\" instead. Similarly, the final log entry should have been \"Reorganized 3 files from /var/log to /processed/logs after successful pre-flight checks.\" but the agent logged it under a different task ID and task name, which does not match the required format. These discrepancies in the audit trail entries could lead to non-compliance with the audit requirements."

In the ground truth, the initial log entry is made with the `LogTaskCompletion` tool using the `task_id` \"F_ADJ_002\", `task_name` \"File Tree Adjustment\", `result` \"Plan Registered\", and `notes` \"Registering plan: Move /var/log to /processed/logs.\". However, in the trajectory, the assistant logs the initial plan using a different `task_id` \"file_reorganization_initial_plan\", `task_name` \"File Reorganization Plan\", and `result` \"Intending to move files from /var/log to /processed/logs\", which does not match the required audit trail entry. This discrepancy in the tool arguments leads to a failure in meeting the specific audit requirements outlined in the user instruction."
