The error message \"'list' object has no attribute 'values'\" indicates a problem with the system's handling of data structures, which is outside the agent's control. Additionally, the error \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\" further suggests a malfunction in the environment's ability to process the logging of changes, preventing the agent from completing the task as instructed."
