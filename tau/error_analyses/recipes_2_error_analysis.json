The agent encountered repeated errors when attempting to add the new recipe and log the actions, which prevented the completion of the task as specified in the user instruction. The ground truth action sequence includes successful execution of these steps, whereas the trajectory shows the agent's inability to perform these actions due to errors."

The error message \"SearchRecipes.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'is_peanut_free'\" indicates that the assistant incorrectly attempted to use the `is_peanut_free` argument, which was not required in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth only required the `title_substring` argument to search for \"Chicken Tacos,\" but the trajectory shows an attempt to use an additional, unnecessary argument, leading to an error."
