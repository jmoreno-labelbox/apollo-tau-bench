Specifically, the environment returned errors such as \"'list' object has no attribute 'values'\" and \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\" when the assistant attempted to add 'Chicken Tacos' to the meal plan and log changes in the audit trail. These errors indicate a malfunction in the system's handling of data structures, which blocked the assistant from executing the required actions to fulfill the user instruction."
