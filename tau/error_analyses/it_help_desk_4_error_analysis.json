Specifically, the errors \"name 'FIXED_NOW' is not defined\" and \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicate issues with the system's ability to process requests for creating directory accounts, retrieving role profiles, provisioning laptops, and creating audit records. These errors are not due to the agent's logic but rather due to the environment's inability to handle the operations correctly, leading to the failure of the onboarding process."
