This indicates that the environment is attempting to access an attribute or method on a string object that does not exist, which is likely due to a misconfiguration or bug in the environment's handling of data types or API responses. This prevents the execution of any actions, including the initial step of finding the candidate by email, which is necessary to proceed with the access verification process."
