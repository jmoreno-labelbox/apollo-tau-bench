Specifically, the agent did not perform the initial steps of querying open invoices up to the specified date and deriving collection KPIs over a 12-month period, which are essential for generating the Accounts Receivable report. Instead, the agent attempted to create a dashboard snapshot without having the required data, leading to errors. Additionally, the agent did not use the correct snapshot date of \"2025-08-23\" as specified in the user instruction, and it failed to provide the correct parameters for creating the dashboard snapshot, resulting in repeated errors."

The ground truth specifies that the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action should be executed with the arguments `snapshot_date` set to \"2025-08-23\" and `pdf_path` set to \"https://test.storage.com/reports/accounts_receivable_2025-08.pdf\". However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to create the snapshot with `snapshot_date` set to \"2025-08-01\" and fails to provide the correct `pdf_path` and other necessary parameters (`ytd_revenue` and `ytd_tax_reserve`). This discrepancy in the tool arguments leads to the failure of the action."
