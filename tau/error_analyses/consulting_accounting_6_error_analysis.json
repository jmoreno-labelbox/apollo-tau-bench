Specifically, the agent did not perform the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action with the correct parameters, and it did not execute the `DeriveCollectionKpis` action at all. Additionally, the agent incorrectly requested unnecessary information (year-to-date revenue and tax reserve) that was not required according to the ground truth action sequence. These omissions and errors prevented the successful completion of the tasks as outlined in the user instruction."

The ground truth specifies that the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action should be invoked with the arguments `snapshot_date` set to \"2025-08-23\" and `pdf_path` set to \"https://test.storage.com/reports/accounts_receivable_2025-08.pdf\". However, in the trajectory, the assistant incorrectly indicates that additional arguments `ytd_revenue` and `ytd_tax_reserve` are required, which are not mentioned in the ground truth. This discrepancy in the required arguments for the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action constitutes the \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
