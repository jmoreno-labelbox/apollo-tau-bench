Specifically, the agent did not perform the `QueryInvoices`, `DeriveCollectionKpis`, and `RenderAccountsReceivableReport` actions, which are essential steps in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent attempted to create a dashboard snapshot without providing the required parameters (`ytd_revenue` and `ytd_tax_reserve`), which were not necessary according to the ground truth. The agent also failed to fetch the dashboard snapshot correctly due to missing parameters. These errors prevented the successful completion of the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

The ground truth specifies that the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action should be invoked with the arguments `snapshot_date` and `pdf_path`. However, the trajectory shows errors indicating missing arguments `ytd_revenue` and `ytd_tax_reserve`, which are not required according to the ground truth. This discrepancy in the expected arguments for the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action led to the fault."
