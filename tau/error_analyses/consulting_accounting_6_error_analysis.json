Specifically, the agent did not successfully perform the `QueryInvoices` action with the correct parameters, which led to a series of errors and an inability to proceed with subsequent actions such as `DeriveCollectionKpis`, `RenderAccountsReceivableReport`, and `CreateDashboardSnapshot`. The agent also failed to handle the creation of the dashboard snapshot with the provided `pdf_path` and did not attempt to fetch the dashboard snapshot as required. The agent's inability to correctly execute these actions resulted in the failure to achieve the goal state as specified in the user instruction."

The ground truth specifies that the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action should be invoked with the arguments `snapshot_date` and `pdf_path`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant incorrectly requests additional arguments `ytd_revenue` and `ytd_tax_reserve`, which are not required according to the ground truth. This discrepancy in the required arguments for the tool invocation constitutes a \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
