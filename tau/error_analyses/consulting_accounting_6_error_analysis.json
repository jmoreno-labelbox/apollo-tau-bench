Specifically, the agent did not perform the necessary actions to create a dashboard snapshot with the specified snapshot date and PDF path. The agent incorrectly insisted on needing additional parameters (YTD revenue and YTD tax reserve) that were not required according to the ground truth action sequence. As a result, the agent did not execute the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` and `FetchDashboardSnapshot` actions, which were essential to fulfill the user's request."

The ground truth specifies that the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action should be invoked with the arguments `snapshot_date` set to \"2025-08-23\" and `pdf_path` set to \"https://test.storage.com/reports/accounts_receivable_2025-08.pdf\". However, in the trajectory, the assistant incorrectly requests additional parameters `ytd_revenue` and `ytd_tax_reserve`, which are not required according to the ground truth. This results in the assistant failing to execute the `CreateDashboardSnapshot` action correctly, leading to the fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\"."
