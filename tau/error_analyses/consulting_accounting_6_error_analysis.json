This suggests that the environment is not correctly handling the input or output data types, leading to a failure in executing the necessary actions to create and fetch the dashboard snapshot as specified in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth requires specific actions to be taken, such as `CreateDashboardSnapshot` and `FetchDashboardSnapshot`, which are not successfully executed in the trajectory due to this error."
