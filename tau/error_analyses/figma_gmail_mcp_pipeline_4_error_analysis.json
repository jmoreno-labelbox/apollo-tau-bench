Specifically, the agent did not successfully perform any of the required actions such as `GetReviewApprovalsSummary`, `UpdateReviewCycleStatus`, `GetAuditsByStatus`, `UpdateAuditStatus`, `UpdateGmailThreadPriority`, `AddTerminalLogEntry`, `GetFilteredLogEntries`, and `GetSystemConfigByCategory`. Instead, the agent repeatedly encountered errors due to missing parameters and did not recover to execute the necessary actions to manage the review cycle SLA and audit workflows. This resulted in the agent not fulfilling the user instruction to oversee the transition of review cycle statuses and audit status monitoring."

In the ground truth action sequence, `GetReviewApprovalsSummary` is correctly invoked with only the `cycle_id` argument, and `GetAuditsByStatus` is invoked with only the `audit_id` argument. However, in the trajectory, the assistant attempts to use these tools with additional, incorrect arguments, leading to errors and failure to perform the intended actions."
