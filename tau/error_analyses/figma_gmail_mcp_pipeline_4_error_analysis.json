The assistant encounters repeated errors due to incorrect handling of tool invocation, specifically using a string object instead of the expected structured input for tool operations. This results in the assistant being unable to update the review cycle status, retrieve audit status, or perform any other necessary actions. Additionally, the assistant does not attempt to log the escalation event or retrieve system configurations, which are part of the ground truth actions. The trajectory ends with an excessive and unnecessary exchange of farewell messages, which does not contribute to resolving the task."
