            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to its failure to execute the correct sequence of actions as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. Specifically, the agent did not perform the following actions:\n\n1. **GetReviewApprovalsSummary**: The agent did not retrieve the review approvals summary for the specified cycle_id, which is a necessary step to understand the current status before making updates.\n\n2. **UpdateReviewCycleStatus**: The agent failed to update the review cycle status from \"NEEDS_REVIEW\" to \"ESCALATED\" with the provided details, which is a critical part of the task.\n\n3. **GetAuditsByStatus** and **UpdateAuditStatus**: The agent encountered repeated errors when attempting to retrieve audit status and did not update the audit status to \"IN_PROGRESS\" as required.\n\n4. **UpdateGmailThreadPriority**: The agent did not update the Gmail thread priority, which is essential for ensuring the communication is marked with the correct urgency.\n\n5. **AddTerminalLogEntry**: The agent did not add a terminal log entry to document the escalation process, which is crucial for maintaining accurate records.\n\n6. **GetFilteredLogEntries** and **GetSystemConfigByCategory**: The agent did not retrieve filtered log entries or system configuration, which are necessary for verifying the logging and configuration settings.\n\nOverall, the agent's inability to execute these actions and its repeated errors in invoking tools with incorrect parameters led to the failure in achieving the task as per the ground truth action sequence."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the agent repeatedly attempts to invoke the `GetAuditsByStatus` tool with incorrect arguments. The ground truth action sequence specifies that `GetAuditsByStatus` should be called with only the `audit_id` argument. However, in the trajectory, the agent attempts to call this tool with various incorrect combinations of arguments, such as missing `audit_id` or including unnecessary arguments like `artifact_id`, `audit_type`, `created_after`, and `created_before`. This discrepancy in the tool arguments leads to errors and prevents the agent from successfully executing the intended actions."
