This resulted in a series of errors, preventing the agent from retrieving Emma Wilson's customer information and proceeding with the subsequent steps necessary to process the refund and apply the discount. In contrast, the ground truth action sequence correctly specifies the `filter_params` with Emma Wilson's name to retrieve the necessary customer information."
