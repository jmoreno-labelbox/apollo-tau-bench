The agent did not provide the required `filter_params` argument, which led to repeated errors. This prevented the agent from retrieving Emma Wilson's customer information, which was necessary to proceed with the refund process and subsequent actions. In contrast, the ground truth action sequence correctly specifies the `filter_params` argument to retrieve the necessary customer information."
