The error message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" suggests that the agent was likely using an incorrect data structure or format for the parameters required by the \"SetProjectConfig\" action. This persistent error prevented the agent from progressing beyond the initial configuration step, whereas the ground truth action sequence successfully set the project configuration and proceeded with subsequent actions."

The error message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" suggests that a list is being used where a different data type is expected. In the ground truth, the `SetProjectConfig` action is successfully executed with the correct arguments: `target_city` as \"Coos Bay\" and `timezone_default` as \"UTC\". The trajectory fails to execute this action correctly due to the misuse of tool arguments, leading to persistent errors."
