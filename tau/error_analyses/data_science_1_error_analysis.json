The agent did not perform actions such as setting the project configuration, storing geocoding results, setting the primary station, storing water levels, storing tide predictions, or computing and storing the merged timeseries. Instead, the agent repeatedly asked for unnecessary details and encountered errors without resolving them, leading to no progress towards the user's goal."

The assistant encounters an error (\"Error: unhashable type: 'list'\") whenever it attempts to perform an action, resulting in none of the necessary configurations or data storage actions being completed. This includes setting the project configuration, storing geocoding results, setting the primary station, storing water levels and tide predictions, and computing and storing the merged timeseries. The assistant's inability to perform these actions due to the error is the primary functional difference between the ground truth and the trajectory."
