As a result, the agent did not successfully record the audit performance evaluation or update the employee's notes as required by the ground truth action sequence."

The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `AddPerformanceReview` tool should be invoked with a complete `performance_review` dictionary, including details such as `review_id`, `employee_id`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `rating`, and `summary`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant failed to provide this argument, resulting in an error and preventing the successful recording of the audit performance evaluation."
