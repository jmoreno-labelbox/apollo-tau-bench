The agent encountered multiple errors related to missing or incorrect arguments when attempting to invoke the `AddPerformanceReview` and `UpdateEmployee` actions. As a result, the performance review was not recorded, and the employee's record was not updated with the necessary information, which deviates from the ground truth action sequence."

Specifically, the assistant used an unexpected keyword argument 'employee_id' and failed to provide the required 'performance_review' argument, which led to multiple errors. In contrast, the ground truth action sequence correctly specifies the `AddPerformanceReview` action with a complete 'performance_review' dictionary containing all necessary details."
