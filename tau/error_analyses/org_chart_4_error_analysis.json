The agent encountered multiple errors when attempting to perform these actions, such as missing required arguments and using incorrect methods, which prevented it from completing the tasks specified in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the agent to update the employee's record with a note and add a performance review, but these actions were not successfully executed in the trajectory."

Additionally, there was an attempt to use an incorrect keyword argument 'employee_id' with `add_performance_review.invoke()`, which is not expected according to the ground truth action sequence. The correct usage should have included a properly structured `performance_review` dictionary as shown in the ground truth."
