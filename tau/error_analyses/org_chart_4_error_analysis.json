The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `AddPerformanceReview` tool should be invoked with a `performance_review` dictionary containing specific fields such as `review_id`, `employee_id`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `rating`, and `summary`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant repeatedly failed to provide this structured argument, resulting in errors and the inability to complete the task."
