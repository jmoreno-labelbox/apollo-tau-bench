Specifically, the `AddPerformanceReview` action was missing the `performance_review` argument, and the `UpdateEmployee` action was missing the `updates` argument. These errors indicate that the assistant did not correctly construct the input data needed for these actions, leading to invocation errors. In contrast, the ground truth action sequence correctly specifies the necessary arguments for these actions."
