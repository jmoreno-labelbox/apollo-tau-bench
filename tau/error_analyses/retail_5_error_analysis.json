The agent attempted to call this action without providing the required arguments `max_price`, `max_stock`, and `min_price`, which led to repeated errors. Additionally, the agent did not proceed with the subsequent actions in the ground truth sequence, such as creating the promotional campaign, identifying top-selling items, and adjusting the price of the highest-priced item. The agent's inability to handle the initial error and move forward with the task resulted in a failure to achieve the user's goal."

The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `searchProductsByCategory` tool should be invoked with only the `category` argument set to \"Running Shoes\". However, the trajectory shows an error indicating that the tool was invoked without the required arguments `max_price`, `max_stock`, and `min_price`, which are not needed according to the ground truth. This discrepancy in the tool's argument usage led to the errors observed in the trajectory."
