Specifically, the errors \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"string indices must be integers\" indicate issues with data handling or API responses that the environment should have managed. Additionally, the error \"name 'generate_unique_id' is not defined\" suggests a missing or improperly configured function in the environment, preventing the creation of the promotional campaign. These errors hindered the agent's ability to perform the necessary actions to fulfill the user instruction."
