Specifically, the environment failed to define necessary functions and handle data types correctly, leading to errors such as \"name 'get_current_timestamp' is not defined\" and \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'.\" These errors prevented the successful execution of actions like creating a promotional campaign, retrieving top-selling products, and searching for products by category, which are crucial steps in the ground truth action sequence. The environment's inability to handle these operations correctly resulted in the agent being unable to fulfill the user's request."
