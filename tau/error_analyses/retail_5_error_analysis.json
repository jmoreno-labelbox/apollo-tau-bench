Specifically, the environment produced an error \"name 'get_current_timestamp' is not defined\" when attempting to create the promotional campaign, and \"string indices must be integers\" when trying to retrieve the top-selling items. These errors prevented the successful execution of the actions required to fulfill the user instruction, leading to the failure of the trajectory."
