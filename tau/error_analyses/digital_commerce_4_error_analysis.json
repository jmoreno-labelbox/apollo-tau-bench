Specifically, the agent did not perform the `AddSubjectTag`, `EmitAnnotation`, and `CreateAuditRecord` actions with the specified parameters, such as tagging the entry with 'Ops', noting 'Index sync verified', and using the event type 'CACHE_ALIGNMENT_EVIDENCE'. Instead, the agent provided incorrect guidance and did not execute the required actions, leading to an error and failure to complete the task."

Additionally, the assistant fails to guide the user to add the correct note \"Index sync verified\" and tag \"Ops\" to the audit log entry, which are specified in the ground truth."
