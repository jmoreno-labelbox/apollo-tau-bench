As a result, none of the necessary actions to update the cache, tag the subject, emit the annotation, or create the audit record were performed, which are all part of the ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth action sequence, the `InvalidateCacheForCatalog` action requires separate `org_id` and `catalog_id` arguments, not a combined string. The assistant's incorrect handling of the input format caused the repeated errors in the trajectory."
