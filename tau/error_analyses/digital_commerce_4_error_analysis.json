Instead, the agent encountered repeated errors ('str' object has no attribute 'get'), indicating a failure in handling the input or invoking the necessary functions. The agent did not perform any of the required actions such as invalidating the cache, running cache jobs, normalizing cache timestamps, adding a subject tag, emitting an annotation, creating an audit record, or retrieving the audit log, as specified in the ground truth action sequence."

The repeated error message \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" suggests that there is a technical issue in the code handling the input, preventing the assistant from performing the necessary actions to update the cache and log the audit entry. This results in no actions being executed, which is a significant deviation from the ground truth action sequence."
