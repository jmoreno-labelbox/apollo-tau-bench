The error message \"name 'get_next_account_id' is not defined\" indicates a missing or undefined function in the environment's code, which prevented the successful creation of the new Savings account. This technical issue in the environment led to the failure of the account creation process, which in turn prevented the subsequent transfer of funds as instructed by the user."
