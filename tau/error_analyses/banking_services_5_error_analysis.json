            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it encountered a system error during the account creation process. Specifically, the error \"name 'get_next_account_id' is not defined\" prevented the creation of the new Savings account. As a result, the subsequent transfer was incorrectly made to an existing Savings account (\"acc_sav_1002\") instead of the newly intended account. This discrepancy between the ground truth and the trajectory indicates that the environment's failure to handle the account creation process correctly led to the fault."
