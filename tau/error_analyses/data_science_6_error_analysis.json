Specifically, the agent did not perform any of the required actions such as `GetWeatherForecast`, `GetTidePredictions`, `GetWaterLevels`, `CreateEtlRunRecord`, or `GetModelMetrics`. Instead, the agent provided guidance and explanations without actually executing the actions needed to fulfill the user instruction. Additionally, the agent encountered errors when attempting to retrieve water-level data and model metrics but did not resolve these issues or proceed with the correct actions."

This led to an error when attempting to retrieve the water levels, as the assistant did not use the correct time range for the water-level lookback."
