            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to execute the necessary actions to adjust the ad set to the plan intended for August 13, 2025. Specifically, the agent encountered errors when attempting to update the ad set's budget and bidding strategy, which were crucial steps in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the agent to set the ad set budget and update the ad set strategy according to the plan, but the agent did not successfully perform these actions due to persistent errors. Consequently, the agent did not ensure that the final aligned state reflected the plan accurately, as required by the user instruction."

The trajectory shows repeated errors with the message \"Error: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", indicating that the assistant attempted to use a method or operation that is not applicable to the data structure being used. This suggests that the assistant used an incorrect tool argument or method for updating the ad set, which differs from the ground truth action sequence where the `SetAdsetBudget` and `UpdateAdsetStrategy` actions were successfully executed with the correct parameters."
