The ground truth action sequence includes a successful retrieval of daily ad set insights and computation of ROAS, whereas the trajectory indicates that there were no recorded insights available, preventing the agent from performing the required analysis and adjustments. Additionally, the environment repeatedly encountered an error ('dict' object has no attribute 'append') when attempting to process further actions, indicating a malfunction in handling the data or executing the plan adjustments."
