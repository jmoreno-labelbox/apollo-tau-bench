Specifically, the agent did not perform the `SetAdsetBudget` and `UpdateAdsetStrategy` actions to update the budget and bid strategy of ad set 104 according to the plan. Additionally, the agent did not verify the final state with the `AppliedStateVerifier` action. Instead, the agent encountered repeated errors due to attempting to use an incorrect method on a dictionary object, which prevented the necessary updates from being applied."

This error occurred when the agent was supposed to adjust the ad set to match the plan for 2025-08-13. In the ground truth action sequence, the agent should have used specific actions like `SetAdsetBudget` and `UpdateAdsetStrategy` with the correct parameters from the plan, but instead, it encountered an error due to using an incorrect method on a dictionary object."
