Specifically, the agent encountered errors when attempting to update the ad set's budget and strategy, which should have been set to a budget of $750 and a bid strategy of \"cost cap\" with a bid amount of $22. These adjustments were not made, and the agent did not successfully apply the changes or verify the final aligned state with the plan, as required by the ground truth action sequence."

Specifically, the tool incorrectly reported an error with the message \"Adset 104 not in plan 3\" when trying to adjust ad set 104, even though ad set 104 was indeed part of the plan as per the ground truth action sequence. This indicates that the tool used an incorrect argument or logic to verify the presence of ad set 104 in the plan, leading to the failure to execute the necessary adjustments."
