            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to provide the necessary insights data for ad set 104 on the date 2025-08-13. The ground truth action sequence involves calculating ROAS using same-day insights, which requires the availability of this data. However, the trajectory indicates that there was no data available to perform the ROAS calculation, leading to the inability to proceed with the subsequent actions of adjusting the ad set according to the plan. This lack of data availability is a functional difference that prevented the completion of the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
