Specifically, the agent encountered errors when attempting to update the ad set's budget and bidding strategy, and it did not successfully execute the `SetAdsetBudget` and `UpdateAdsetStrategy` actions as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent did not perform the `AppliedStateVerifier` action to confirm the alignment with the plan, which was part of the ground truth sequence."

The assistant encountered errors such as \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\" and \"UpdateAdsetStrategy.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'new_budget'\", indicating that the tool was invoked with incorrect arguments or in an incorrect manner. In the ground truth action sequence, the `SetAdsetBudget` and `UpdateAdsetStrategy` actions are used separately with specific arguments, but the trajectory shows attempts to update these settings that resulted in errors, suggesting a misuse of tool arguments."
