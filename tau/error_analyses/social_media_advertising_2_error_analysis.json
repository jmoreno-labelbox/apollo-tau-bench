Specifically, the agent did not perform the \"SetAdsetBudget\" and \"UpdateAdsetStrategy\" actions to align the ad set with the plan, and it encountered repeated errors ('dict' object has no attribute 'append') instead of successfully updating the ad set's budget and strategy. Additionally, the agent did not verify the final state with \"AppliedStateVerifier\" to ensure it matched the intended plan."

Specifically, after retrieving the plan details, the assistant should have used the \"SetAdsetBudget\" and \"UpdateAdsetStrategy\" tools with the correct arguments to adjust the ad set 104 according to the plan. Instead, the assistant attempted to perform an operation on a dictionary object that does not support the 'append' method, indicating a misuse of the tool or incorrect handling of the data structure. This differs from the ground truth, where the correct tools and arguments were used to adjust the ad set budget and strategy."
