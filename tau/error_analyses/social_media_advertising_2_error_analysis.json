Specifically, the agent did not perform the `SetAdsetBudget` and `UpdateAdsetStrategy` actions to align ad set 104 with the plan_2025-08-13, which included setting the budget to $750 and updating the bid strategy to \"cost_cap\" with a bid amount of $22. Instead, the agent encountered repeated errors ('dict' object has no attribute 'append') and did not successfully update the ad set as required. Additionally, the agent did not perform the `AppliedStateVerifier` action to ensure the final state reflected the plan accurately."
