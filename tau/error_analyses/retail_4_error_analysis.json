This indicates that the environment did not execute any actions or facilitate any interaction between the user and the agent, preventing the task from progressing. The ground truth action sequence shows a series of actions that should have been taken, starting with validating the user identity, but none of these actions were initiated due to the environment's failure to set up the task properly."
