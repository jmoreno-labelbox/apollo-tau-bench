The ground truth action sequence begins with a \"ValidateUserIdentity\" action, which is crucial for proceeding with the task. However, the trajectory is empty, indicating that this initial step was not executed, preventing any further actions from taking place. This suggests an issue with the environment's ability to handle user identity validation or task initialization."
