Instead, it attempted to create a campaign with the name \"Specific Campaign for Client 9\" and type \"email\", which does not match the user instruction. Consequently, the subsequent actions that relied on the correct campaign ID failed, resulting in repeated errors indicating that \"campaign_id 9 not found\". The agent did not follow the ground truth action sequence, which required creating the campaign with the correct parameters and then proceeding with the other tasks."

The ground truth specifies that the campaign type should be \"likely_buyer\", but in the trajectory, the campaign was created with the type \"email\". This discrepancy led to the subsequent errors when trying to access the campaign with ID 9, as the campaign was not created with the correct specifications."
