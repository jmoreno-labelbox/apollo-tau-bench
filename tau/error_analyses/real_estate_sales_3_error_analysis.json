Instead, it created a campaign with the name \"New Campaign for Client 9\" and type \"email\", which does not match the requirements.

The campaign was created with the name \"New Campaign for Client 9\" and type \"email\", whereas the ground truth specifies that the campaign should be named \"Aug 2025 Likely Buyer \u2014 Client 9 Comp Pack\" and should be of type \"likely_buyer\". This discrepancy in the campaign name and type led to subsequent errors when trying to reference the campaign by its ID, as the expected campaign was not created correctly."
