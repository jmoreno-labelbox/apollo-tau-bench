This prevents the agent from executing any of the actions in the ground truth action sequence, such as retrieving risk profiles, making loan payments, adjusting overdraft limits, checking scheduled payments, closing accounts, enforcing KYC updates, and reassigning relationship managers. The environment's inability to recognize the provided identifiers leads to a failure in completing the tasks as instructed."
