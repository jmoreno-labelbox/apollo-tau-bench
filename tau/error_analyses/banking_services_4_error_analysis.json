Instead, the trajectory consists of irrelevant dialogue about identifying potential successors for a Backend Tech Lead role, which is unrelated to the user instruction. The environment did not facilitate the execution of actions such as obtaining risk profiles, making a loan overpayment, adjusting an overdraft limit, checking scheduled payments, closing an account, enforcing a KYC update, or reassigning a relationship manager, which were all specified in the user instruction."
