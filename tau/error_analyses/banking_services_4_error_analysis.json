This prevents the agent from executing any of the actions in the ground truth action sequence, such as retrieving risk profiles, adjusting overdraft limits, making loan payments, or closing accounts. The environment's inability to recognize valid customer and account IDs leads to a failure in performing the required tasks, despite the user providing accurate information."
