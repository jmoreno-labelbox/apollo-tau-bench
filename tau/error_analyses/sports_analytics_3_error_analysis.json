Instead of following the ground truth action sequence, which involves fetching team details, player details, and filtering grades, the agent encountered errors related to team identification and bullpen sessions. Additionally, the agent did not create new reports or goals for the correct players, as specified in the ground truth, and instead attempted to set goals for incorrect players without successfully executing the necessary actions."

The ground truth involves using tools like `GetTeamDetailsByName`, `GetAllPlayersOfTeam`, `GetAllPitchesByPitcherIds`, and `GetFilteredGradesByPitchIds` to gather the necessary data on player performance, which was not done in the trajectory. Instead, the trajectory incorrectly attempted to retrieve bullpen session information, which is not relevant to the task of identifying high-grade performance pitchers."
