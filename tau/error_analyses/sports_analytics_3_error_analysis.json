            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it failed to recognize the team \"Lightning\" (KC) and retrieve the necessary data. The ground truth action sequence begins with retrieving team details using the \"GetTeamDetailsByName\" action, which successfully identifies the team and proceeds with further actions. However, in the trajectory, the environment repeatedly returns errors indicating that no teams were found with the name \"Kansas City Lightning\" or in the specified leagues, preventing the agent from executing the correct sequence of actions to fulfill the user instruction. This discrepancy between the ground truth and the trajectory indicates an issue with the environment's database or team recognition capabilities."
