This prevented the agent from retrieving the necessary team details and player information to proceed with the analysis as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The environment's inability to provide the correct team data led to a breakdown in the process, as the agent could not access the required information to identify high-grade performing pitchers and establish reinforcement targets."
