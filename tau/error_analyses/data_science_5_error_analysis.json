The agent did not perform the `WriteProcessedSeries` action to store the temperature anomaly data, nor did it execute the `RenderQcReport` and `RecordQcReport` actions properly. Additionally, the agent encountered repeated errors with the `ReadQcReport` action due to missing required arguments, indicating a failure to handle the QC report generation and retrieval process as specified in the ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth, the `RecordQcReport` action includes the correct arguments: `figure_label`, `figure_path`, and `artifact_type`. The absence of `related_model_name` in the trajectory leads to an error, preventing the successful recording of the QC report."
