Additionally, the agent incorrectly used the series name \"temperature_anomaly_april_2025\" instead of the correct \"temp_anom_2025-04\". Furthermore, the agent did not perform the \"RenderQcReport\", \"RecordQcReport\", \"ReadQcReport\", \"AppendAuditEvent\", and \"ReadAuditEvents\" actions as specified in the ground truth action sequence. These omissions and errors led to the failure to achieve the final outcome as instructed."

The ground truth specifies the `series_name` as \"temp_anom_2025-04\", but the trajectory used \"temperature_anomaly_april_2025\" instead. This discrepancy in the `series_name` argument is the functional difference that led to the fault."
