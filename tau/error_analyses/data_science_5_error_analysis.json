The agent repeatedly attempted to invoke `WriteProcessedSeries` without providing the required `items` argument, which led to errors. This prevented the successful entry of the data points into the system, which is a critical step in the ground truth action sequence. Consequently, the subsequent actions, such as reading the processed series and generating the QC report, could not be performed as intended."

In the ground truth, `ReadProcessedSeries` is invoked with only the `series_name` argument, which is sufficient for the task. The trajectory incorrectly attempts to invoke `ReadProcessedSeries` without these additional arguments, leading to an error."
