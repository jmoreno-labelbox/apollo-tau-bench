Specifically, the agent did not perform the \"WriteProcessedSeries\" action to store the temperature anomaly data, nor did it execute the \"RenderQcReport\" and \"RecordQcReport\" actions with the correct parameters. Additionally, the agent encountered multiple errors, such as missing arguments and undefined variables, which prevented it from completing the task as specified in the ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth action sequence, `RecordQcReport` is correctly invoked with the arguments `figure_label`, `figure_path`, and `artifact_type`, but the trajectory fails to include the `related_model_name`, leading to an error."
