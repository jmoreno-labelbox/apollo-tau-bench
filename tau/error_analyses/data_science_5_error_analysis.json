This error prevented the execution of any actions, including logging the temperature anomaly metrics and proceeding with the subsequent steps required to handle the delivery of the temperature anomaly record. As a result, the trajectory could not progress beyond the initial attempt to log the metrics, leading to a failure in achieving the goal state."
