The error message \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicates a systemic issue with the environment's handling of data operations, which prevents the successful execution of actions such as writing the processed series, rendering the QC report, and recording the QC report. This issue is not present in the ground truth action sequence, where these operations are completed without error. The environment's failure to support these operations is the root cause of the fault."
