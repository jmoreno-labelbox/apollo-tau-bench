The repeated errors, such as \"Feature set not found\" and \"name '_fixed_now_iso' is not defined\", indicate that the environment is not properly configured to handle the creation of feature sets or the insertion of data points. This prevented the agent from successfully writing the processed series and proceeding with the subsequent steps, such as generating the QC report, which are part of the ground truth action sequence."
