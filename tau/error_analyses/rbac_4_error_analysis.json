The user instruction specifies that only Operations reviewers can approve requests for RES-025, and if the reviewer does not have the required authorization, the request should be dismissed. The required outputs indicate that the request should have been rejected, but the trajectory does not reflect this decision. Instead, the agent incorrectly processed the request, leading to a discrepancy between the expected rejection and the actual handling of the request."
