The user instruction specifies that only Operations reviewers can approve requests for RES-025, and all permissions must be restricted to RES-025. If these conditions are not met, the request should be dismissed. The required outputs indicate that the request should have been rejected, but the trajectory does not reflect this decision. Instead, the agent incorrectly processed the request, leading to a discrepancy between the expected rejection and the actual handling of the request."
