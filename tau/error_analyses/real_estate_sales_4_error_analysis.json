In the ground truth, the \"type\" is specified as \"client_onboarding\", whereas in the trajectory, it was incorrectly set to \"general_update\". This discrepancy indicates a functional difference in how the campaign was categorized, which could affect subsequent processes and communications related to the client onboarding."
