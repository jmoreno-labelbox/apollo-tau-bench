Instead, the agent encountered repeated errors and did not progress with the onboarding process as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

The user provided the start time as \"2025-09-20T09:00:00Z-10:00:00Z\", which is not a valid ISO 8601 format. The correct format should be \"2025-09-20T09:00:00-10:00\" without the 'Z' before the timezone offset. This discrepancy led to errors in the tool invocation, as the assistant could not process the provided time correctly."
