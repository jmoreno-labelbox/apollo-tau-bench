This indicates a malfunction in the environment's handling of the tool invocation, likely due to incorrect data types or improper handling of the input parameters. Additionally, the error \"FindClients.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'client_id'\" suggests that the environment failed to correctly pass the required arguments to the function, preventing the execution of the intended actions. These issues prevented the agent from performing any actions, leading to a failure in executing the ground truth action sequence."
