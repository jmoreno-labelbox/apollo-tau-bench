The trajectory is empty, indicating that no actions were taken, which suggests that the environment did not properly set up the initial conditions or failed to recognize the user's instruction to begin executing the necessary actions. This is a functional difference from the ground truth, where a sequence of actions is expected to be executed to fulfill the user's request."
