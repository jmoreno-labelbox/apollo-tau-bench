The agent encountered an error (\"Error: string indices must be integers\") while attempting to process the transfer of $100 from the checking account to the savings account with the description \"Personal transfer.\" This error prevented the completion of the transaction, which was a required step in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent did not retrieve the rewards points information for the credit card account, which was part of the user instruction."

The ground truth specifies using the \"CreateTransaction\" tool with specific arguments: \"source_account_id\", \"destination_account_id\", \"amount\", and \"description\". However, in the trajectory, the tool usage resulted in an error (\"Error: string indices must be integers\"), indicating that the tool was not used correctly, likely due to incorrect or missing arguments. This error prevented the successful execution of the transfer action."
