The agent repeatedly encountered an error due to missing required parameters ('list_id' and 'name') when attempting to invoke the `CreateCustomList` action. This prevented the successful creation of the shopping list, which is a necessary step in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent did not proceed to activate the scene or retrieve the updated status of the devices and the shopping list, which are also required actions in the ground truth sequence."

The assistant failed to provide the correct arguments when invoking the `CreateCustomList` action. Specifically, the `new_list` argument, which should include the `list_id`, `name`, and `items`, was not correctly structured or provided, leading to repeated errors indicating that the new list must have 'list_id' and 'name'. This differs from the ground truth action sequence, where the `CreateCustomList` action is correctly invoked with the necessary `new_list` argument containing all required details."
