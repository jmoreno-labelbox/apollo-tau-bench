The agent encountered repeated errors indicating that the `CreateCustomList` action was missing the required `new_list` argument, which should have included the `list_id`, `name`, and `items`. This prevented the successful creation of the shopping list, which is a necessary step in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent did not proceed to activate the scene or retrieve the updated status of the devices and the shopping list, as required by the user instruction."

This resulted in repeated errors indicating that the new list must have 'list_id' and 'name', which were not correctly specified in the trajectory."
