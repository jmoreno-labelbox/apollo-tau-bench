The agent encountered errors when attempting to create the scene due to incorrect parameters ('id' and 'name' instead of 'scene_id') and did not successfully create the custom list due to missing required parameters ('new_list' with 'list_id' and 'name'). These errors prevented the agent from executing the ground truth action sequence correctly."

Specifically, the `CreateScene` action was attempted without providing the correct `id` argument, and the `CreateCustomList` action was attempted without providing the `new_list` argument containing both `list_id` and `name`. These errors indicate that the assistant used incorrect or incomplete arguments for these actions, leading to failures in creating the scene and the shopping list as specified in the user instruction."
