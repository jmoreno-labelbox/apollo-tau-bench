Additionally, the agent did not update the flight status for HAT170 and HAT124 to \"delayed\" or send user notifications about the delay, which are necessary actions to manage the situation effectively. The agent also incorrectly referenced the date as October 5, 2023, instead of the correct date, May 22, 2024, leading to confusion and errors in processing the flight information."

In the ground truth action sequence, the \"UpdateFlightStatusForDate\" tool is used with the argument \"flight_numbers\" set to a list containing the specific flight number (e.g., [\"HAT170\"]). However, in the trajectory, there is no evidence that this tool was correctly used with the specified flight numbers and date. Instead, the trajectory shows errors and empty responses, indicating that the tool was not used correctly or the arguments were not properly set, leading to the failure to update the flight status as required."
