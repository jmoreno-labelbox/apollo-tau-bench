This indicates that the environment did not execute any actions or facilitate any interaction, which is necessary to follow the user instruction and achieve the goal state. The ground truth action sequence involves multiple steps to manage flight delays due to a SIGMET, but none of these actions were initiated or completed in the trajectory."
