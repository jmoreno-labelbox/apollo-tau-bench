            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to a persistent error message: \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\". This indicates that the environment is attempting to access an attribute or method on a string object that does not exist, which is likely due to a misconfiguration or bug in the environment's handling of data types. This error prevents the execution of any actions, leading to the failure of the entire sequence. Additionally, the error \"name '_j' is not defined\" suggests a possible issue with variable initialization or scope within the environment. These errors are unrelated to the user's input or the agent's logic, indicating an environment-level fault."
