The agent incorrectly attempted to process the request using the current date (2023-10-05) instead of the specified date (2024-05-22). This led to errors and the inability to log the SIGMET event or apply the necessary delays to flights HAT170 and HAT124. Additionally, the agent did not create the operational event or update the flight statuses as required by the ground truth action sequence."
