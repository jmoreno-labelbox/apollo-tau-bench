The errors, such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"name '_j' is not defined,\" indicate that there were issues with the environment's handling of the code or data structures, preventing the successful execution of the required actions. These errors suggest that the environment was not properly set up to process the actions, leading to a failure in executing the necessary steps to manage the flight delays as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
