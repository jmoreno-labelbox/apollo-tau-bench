This action is crucial for documenting the impact of the SIGMET on the airport operations and was part of the ground truth action sequence. The agent encountered an error ('str' object has no attribute 'get') while attempting this action and did not successfully retry or resolve the issue, leading to incomplete execution of the required protocol."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is due to the incorrect use of the tool arguments when attempting to log the operational event. The ground truth action sequence specifies the use of the `CreateOperationalEvent` tool with specific arguments, including `airport_id`, `event_type`, `details`, and `event_timestamp_utc`. However, in the trajectory, the assistant encounters an error: \"Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'\", indicating that the tool was not used correctly, likely due to incorrect or missing arguments. This error prevents the successful logging of the operational event, which is a critical step in the ground truth action sequence."
