These errors indicate that the agent did not correctly execute the required actions.\n\nThese issues led to the failure in correctly implementing the user's instructions for scheduling device updates."

The assistant attempted to use `ScheduleDeviceTimerUpdate.invoke()` but encountered an error because it was missing the required positional argument 'update'. The correct tool to use should have been `ScheduleDeviceUpdate` with the appropriate 'update' argument specifying the power state change. This resulted in the failure to properly schedule the AC to turn off at the specified time."
