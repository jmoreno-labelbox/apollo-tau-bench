The agent encountered repeated errors due to missing the required 'update' argument in the `UpdateDeviceState` invocation, preventing the AC from being activated with the specified settings. This error also halted further actions, such as opening the curtain and adjusting the floor lamp, which were part of the required sequence when the temperature exceeded 22\u00b0C."

Specifically, the agent failed to provide the required 'update' argument, which should include the settings for the AC (power, mode, setpoint_c, and fan_speed). Instead, the agent's attempts resulted in errors indicating missing or unexpected arguments, preventing the AC from being activated with the specified settings. In contrast, the ground truth action sequence correctly uses the `UpdateDeviceStateTimer` tool with the appropriate 'update' argument to set the AC to the desired state."
