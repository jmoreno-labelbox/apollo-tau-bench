Specifically, the agent failed to correctly use the `UpdateDeviceStateTimer` and `ScheduleDeviceUpdate` actions to schedule the devices to revert to different settings at 16:30. The errors indicate incorrect usage of arguments and methods, resulting in the failure to set the AC to power off, adjust the curtain to 50% position, and set the lamp to 60% brightness at the specified time."

Specifically, the assistant encountered errors such as \"UpdateDeviceStateTimer.invoke() got an unexpected keyword argument 'replace'\" and \"ScheduleDeviceTimerUpdate.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'update'\". These errors indicate that the assistant used incorrect or missing arguments when trying to schedule the devices to revert to different settings at 16:30, which deviates from the correct usage demonstrated in the ground truth action sequence."
