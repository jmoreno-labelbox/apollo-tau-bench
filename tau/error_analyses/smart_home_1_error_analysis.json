The correct usage requires a single 'update' argument containing the desired state changes, but the agent provided separate arguments like 'power' and 'mode', which are not valid.\n\n2. **Failure to Schedule Device Updates**: The agent did not schedule the necessary updates for the devices to readjust at 16:30. The ground truth specifies using `ScheduleDeviceUpdate` for the curtain and floor lamp, but the agent failed to execute these actions.\n\n3. **Repeated Errors**: The agent repeatedly encountered errors related to an undefined variable `_now_iso`, indicating a failure in handling time-based operations or scheduling, which is crucial for the task.\n\nThese issues prevented the agent from executing the required actions to adjust the devices as per the user instruction."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the `UpdateDeviceState` tool was invoked with incorrect arguments. Specifically, the tool was called with unexpected keyword arguments such as 'power' and 'mode', which are not directly accepted by `UpdateDeviceState`. Instead, these parameters should have been included within an 'update' dictionary argument, as shown in the ground truth action sequence. This incorrect usage led to errors and prevented the successful execution of the intended actions."
