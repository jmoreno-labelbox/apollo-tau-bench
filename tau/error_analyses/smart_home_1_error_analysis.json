The agent attempted to use `UpdateDeviceState` with incorrect arguments, leading to errors. The correct action should have been `UpdateDeviceStateTimer` with the appropriate parameters for setting the AC to cool mode, 22\u00b0C, and high fan speed until 16:30. Additionally, the agent did not schedule the necessary updates for the curtain and floor lamp at 16:30, as specified in the user instruction."

Specifically, the tool was called with separate arguments for 'power', 'mode', 'setpoint_c', and 'fan_speed', instead of using a single 'update' argument that encapsulates these parameters as a dictionary. This mismatch in argument structure led to errors, as the tool expected a single 'update' argument containing all the necessary state changes."
