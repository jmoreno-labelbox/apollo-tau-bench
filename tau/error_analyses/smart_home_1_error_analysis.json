The correct usage should have included an 'update' dictionary with the appropriate parameters.\n\n2. **Failure to Schedule Updates**: The agent did not schedule the necessary updates for the devices to automatically readjust at 16:30. The ground truth sequence includes `ScheduleDeviceUpdate` actions for the curtain and floor lamp, which are missing in the trajectory.\n\n3. **Repeated Errors**: The agent repeatedly encountered errors related to the `UpdateDeviceState` and `_now_iso` not being defined, indicating a failure to handle these errors and proceed with the correct actions.\n\nThese issues prevented the agent from executing the required actions to achieve the user's goals."

Specifically, the tool was called with unexpected keyword arguments such as 'power' and 'setpoint_c', which are not valid for the `UpdateDeviceState` tool. Additionally, the tool was missing the required 'update' argument, which should have been provided as a dictionary specifying the state changes for the device. These errors indicate that the tool was not used correctly according to its expected input parameters, leading to the failure in executing the intended actions."
