The correct method should have been `UpdateDeviceStateTimer` with the appropriate parameters for immediate activation and scheduled deactivation.\n\n2. **Failure to Schedule Device Updates**: The agent failed to schedule the device updates for 16:30. The errors indicate that the agent used an incorrect method (`ScheduleDeviceTimerUpdate`) and did not provide the required 'update' argument. The correct method should have been `ScheduleDeviceUpdate` with the appropriate parameters for each device.\n\nThese errors prevented the agent from executing the necessary actions to meet the user's requirements."

The correct tool to use is `ScheduleDeviceUpdate`, which requires the `device_id`, `timestamp`, and `update` arguments. The assistant's errors indicate that it did not provide the necessary `update` argument correctly, leading to multiple invocation errors. This differs from the ground truth, where the `ScheduleDeviceUpdate` tool was used correctly with the appropriate arguments to schedule the device updates at the specified time."
