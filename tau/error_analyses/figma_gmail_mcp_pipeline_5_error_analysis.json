This indicates a technical issue with the environment's handling of the `SearchGmailThreads` action, preventing the agent from executing the necessary actions to verify and update the Gmail thread as specified in the ground truth action sequence. The environment's failure to process the search request correctly is the root cause of the trajectory fault."
