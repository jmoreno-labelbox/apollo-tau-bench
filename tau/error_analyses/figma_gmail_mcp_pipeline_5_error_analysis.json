Specifically, the environment returned errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", which indicate that the system was unable to process the actions required to update the thread labels and perform the DLP assessment. These errors prevented the agent from completing the tasks outlined in the ground truth action sequence, such as updating the labels on the Gmail thread and confirming the DLP assessment, leading to the failure in achieving the intended goal."
