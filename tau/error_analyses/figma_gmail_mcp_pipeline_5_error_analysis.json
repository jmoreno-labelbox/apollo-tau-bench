Specifically, the environment encountered repeated errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", which blocked the agent from performing actions like updating thread labels and conducting a DLP assessment. These errors indicate that the environment's tools or APIs were malfunctioning, preventing the agent from following the ground truth action sequence."
