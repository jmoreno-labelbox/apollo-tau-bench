The error message \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicates a problem with how the environment is handling the requests, likely due to a misconfiguration or bug in the system that processes these actions. This prevented the agent from executing the necessary actions to update the thread labels and perform the DLP scan, which are critical steps in the ground truth action sequence."
