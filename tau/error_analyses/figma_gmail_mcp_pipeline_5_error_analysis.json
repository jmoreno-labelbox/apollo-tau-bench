Specifically, the errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"SearchGmailThreadsTool.invoke() missing required positional arguments\" indicate that the environment failed to properly handle the tool invocations and manage the required parameters for the actions. These errors prevented the successful execution of the \"SearchGmailThreads,\" \"UpdateThreadLabels,\" and \"DlpScanThread\" actions, which are necessary to achieve the user's goal as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
