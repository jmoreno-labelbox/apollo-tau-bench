Specifically, the errors \"name '_small_fields' is not defined\" and \"name '_require_str' is not defined\" indicate that the environment failed to provide the necessary functionality for the agent to retrieve the thread details and perform the label adjustments and DLP scan. This prevented the agent from completing the tasks outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
