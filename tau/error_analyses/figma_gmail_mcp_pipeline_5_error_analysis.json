This prevented the agent from correctly identifying the email thread.\n\n2. **Failure to Update Thread Labels**: The agent encountered a persistent error (\"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\") when attempting to update the thread labels using the `UpdateThreadLabels` tool. This error was not resolved, and the agent did not successfully add the \"triaged\" and \"figma-sync\" labels or remove the \"urgent\" label as specified in the user instruction.\n\n3. **DLP Scan Failure**: The agent also failed to perform the `DlpScanThread` action due to the same error, preventing the confirmation of the email thread's alignment with data loss prevention policies.\n\nOverall, the agent did not execute the necessary actions to achieve the goal state as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

The error message indicates that the `SearchGmailThreadsTool.invoke()` was missing the required positional arguments 'keyword' and 'participant'. This suggests that the tool was invoked without the necessary arguments that were specified in the ground truth action sequence. The ground truth required the `SearchGmailThreads` action to include the 'label', 'participant', and 'keyword' arguments, but the trajectory failed to provide these correctly, leading to the error."
