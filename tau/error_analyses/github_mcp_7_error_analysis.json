This prevents the assistant from executing any of the necessary actions to fulfill the user instruction, such as creating a repository, opening a pull request, adding a label, or listing open pull requests. The ground truth action sequence involves creating a repository, branches, commits, and a pull request, which the assistant is unable to perform due to the environment's failure to provide access or authenticate the necessary operations."
