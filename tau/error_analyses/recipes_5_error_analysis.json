Specifically, the environment failed to provide necessary user and household information, which led to the inability to execute actions like retrieving household data or creating a meal plan. The errors such as \"missing 1 required positional argument: 'user_id'\" and \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" indicate that the environment did not supply the correct context or data structure needed for the agent to perform the required operations."
