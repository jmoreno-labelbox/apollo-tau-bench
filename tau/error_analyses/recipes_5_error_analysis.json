This function is likely needed for processing or formatting data, and its absence prevents the agent from executing the necessary actions to fulfill the user instruction. As a result, the agent is unable to proceed with creating the meal plan, adding meal entries, or generating and categorizing the grocery list, leading to a failure in achieving the goal state."
