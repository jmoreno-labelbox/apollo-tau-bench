The errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and missing required positional arguments indicate that the environment failed to provide the correct data structures or API responses needed for the agent to perform actions like retrieving household information, creating meal plans, and compiling grocery lists. These technical issues hindered the agent's ability to follow the ground truth action sequence."
