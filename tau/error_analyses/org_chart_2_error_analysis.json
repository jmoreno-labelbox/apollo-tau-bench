This led to confusion and prevented the agent from proceeding with the promotion actions.\n\n2. **Failure to Update Employee Records**: The agent did not perform the necessary updates to Emma Rodriguez's position, level, and compensation, which are critical steps in the ground truth action sequence.\n\n3. **Performance Review Logging Errors**: The agent encountered repeated errors when attempting to log a performance review for Amelia Garcia, failing to structure the request correctly and not completing this required action.\n\n4. **Retrieval of Updated Records**: The agent failed to retrieve the updated employee records for verification, encountering errors in the process.\n\nOverall, the agent's inability to correctly identify and update the employee records, log the performance review, and verify the changes led to the failure in achieving the intended goal state as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

            "description": "The fault in the trajectory is due to the incorrect use of the `UpdateEmployee` tool. The assistant attempted to update Michael Park's reporting structure without providing the necessary 'updates' argument, which specifies the changes to be made. This resulted in an error: `update_employee.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'updates'`. In the ground truth, the `UpdateEmployee` action for Michael Park correctly includes the 'updates' argument with the 'manager_id' set to Emma Rodriguez's ID (E10003). The trajectory failed to execute this action correctly due to the missing argument."
