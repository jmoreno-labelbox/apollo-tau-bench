Specifically, the agent failed to correctly execute the `UpdateEmployee`, `IncreaseEmployeeCompensation`, and `AddPerformanceReview` actions due to missing required arguments or incorrect keyword arguments. These errors prevented the successful update of the employee's position, compensation, and performance review, which are critical steps in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent did not coordinate the reassignment of Michael Park as a direct report to Emma Rodriguez, nor did it retrieve the updated employee information for verification, as required by the user instruction."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the assistant attempted to use the `set_compensation` tool with incorrect arguments. Specifically, the assistant used unexpected keyword arguments such as 'employee_id', 'compensation_id', and 'effective_date', which are not valid for the `set_compensation` tool. Instead, the correct tool to use for updating compensation is `IncreaseEmployeeCompensation`, which requires specific arguments like 'employee_id', 'compensation_id', 'effective_date', and 'salary_increase_pct'. This mismatch in tool usage and arguments led to errors in the trajectory."
