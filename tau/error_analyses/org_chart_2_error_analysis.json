This resulted in a series of errors and prevented the agent from executing the necessary actions to update Emma Rodriguez's position and complete the other tasks outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The agent failed to correctly initiate the `GetEmployee` action with the correct parameters, which was the first step in the ground truth sequence."
