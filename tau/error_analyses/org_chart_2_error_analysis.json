Initially, the agent failed to retrieve the employee information correctly due to missing required arguments in the `search_employees.invoke()` function. Subsequently, the agent encountered errors in updating the employee and setting compensation due to missing required arguments and incorrect argument usage in the `update_employee.invoke()` and `set_compensation.invoke()` functions. These errors prevented the agent from executing the necessary actions to promote Emma Rodriguez, update her compensation, and log the performance review, as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

Specifically, the assistant used the argument `employee_id` with the `set_compensation` tool, which is not a valid argument for this tool. In the ground truth, the correct tool `IncreaseEmployeeCompensation` is used with the appropriate arguments, including `employee_id`, `compensation_id`, `effective_date`, and `salary_increase_pct`. The trajectory's incorrect use of tool arguments led to errors and failed to execute the intended actions."
