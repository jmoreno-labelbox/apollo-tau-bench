This resulted in multiple errors and prevented the successful execution of the necessary actions to handle the promotion, salary increase, and reassignment tasks outlined in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the agent failed to retrieve and update the necessary employee information, leading to a failure in completing the task as instructed."
