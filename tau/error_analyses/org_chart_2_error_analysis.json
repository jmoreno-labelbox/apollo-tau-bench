This resulted in a series of errors and prevented the agent from proceeding with the necessary actions to process Emma Rodriguez's promotion, such as updating her job title, creating a new compensation record, adding a performance review, and reassigning Michael Park as her direct report. The agent failed to use the correct function or provide the necessary parameters to retrieve Emma's employee information, which was a critical first step in the ground truth action sequence."
