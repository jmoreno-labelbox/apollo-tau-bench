This resulted in a series of errors and prevented the agent from executing the necessary actions to handle Emma Rodriguez's promotion, as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The agent failed to correctly initiate the process by not using the `GetEmployee` action with the correct `employee_id`, which is essential for proceeding with the subsequent updates and verifications."
