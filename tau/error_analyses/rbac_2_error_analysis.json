This error indicates a problem with the environment's handling of the tool's response or the tool's internal logic, preventing the successful assignment of roles and subsequent actions. Additionally, the initial error \"Error: name 'NOW' is not defined\" suggests a failure in the environment to provide the current time, which is necessary for logging and timestamping actions. These issues hinder the completion of the onboarding process as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
