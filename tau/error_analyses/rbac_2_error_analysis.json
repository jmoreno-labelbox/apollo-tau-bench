This indicates a malfunction or misconfiguration in the environment's handling of tool responses, preventing the assistant from executing the necessary actions to complete the onboarding process. As a result, the assistant is unable to proceed with assigning roles, logging audit events, or sending notifications, which are critical steps in the ground truth action sequence."
