This error prevented the agent from retrieving the necessary ad set data to proceed with the subsequent actions, such as applying budget cuts and changing bid strategies, as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. The environment's failure to provide the correct data or handle the request properly led to the agent being unable to fulfill the user's instruction."
