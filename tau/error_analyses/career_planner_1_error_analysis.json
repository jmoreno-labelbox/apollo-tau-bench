The system repeatedly encounters an error: \"'dict_values' object has no attribute 'values'\", which prevents the assistant from authenticating the user and proceeding with the requested actions. This error indicates a malfunction in the environment's handling of user authentication, which is a prerequisite for executing the subsequent actions in the ground truth action sequence. As a result, the assistant is unable to perform any of the tasks related to managing the job applications, leading to a failure in achieving the user's goal."
