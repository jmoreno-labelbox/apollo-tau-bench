Instead, the agent attempted to update the status of flights departing from ATL individually and did not apply the required delay. Additionally, the agent encountered an error due to the undefined 'timedelta' function, which indicates a failure to correctly implement the delay operation. The ground truth action sequence required a single update operation to apply the delay, which the agent did not perform."

Instead of updating the flight schedule with a 3-hour delay and changing the status to \"DELAYED\" for flights with the status \"available\" to ATL, the agent updated flights departing from ATL and only changed their status to \"DELAYED\" without applying the 3-hour delay. Additionally, the updates were not performed in a single operation as required."
