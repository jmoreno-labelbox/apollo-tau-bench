            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory due to a persistent system error indicated by the message \"Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'\". This error prevented the agent from executing any actions related to the supply order, such as approving the order, transitioning it to 'in_transit', and handling its receipt and closing. Consequently, the agent was unable to perform the necessary operations to manage the supply order as outlined in the ground truth action sequence. Additionally, the environment failed to provide the correct order details for Ahmad Ahmed, resulting in the agent's inability to update the order with the newly repriced T-Shirt and nullify the payment. These issues highlight a malfunction in the environment's ability to process and respond to the agent's requests accurately."
