This resulted in repeated errors and prevented the agent from progressing through the action sequence. The agent's inability to handle the initial step of finding the supply order led to a complete failure in executing the subsequent actions outlined in the ground truth action sequence."

The ground truth action sequence specifies that the `FindSupplyOrders` tool should be called with both 'supplier_id' and 'status' arguments, but the trajectory shows repeated errors indicating that the 'status' argument was missing. This discrepancy in tool invocation arguments led to the errors observed in the trajectory."
