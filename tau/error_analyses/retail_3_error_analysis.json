The errors such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"Order 'W7007896' not found\" indicate that the environment's database or API calls are not functioning as expected, leading to the inability to find and update the necessary orders. This discrepancy between the ground truth and the trajectory suggests that the environment did not correctly simulate the presence of these orders, which should have been available for processing according to the user instruction and ground truth action sequence."
