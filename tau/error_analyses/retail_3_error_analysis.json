This suggests that the environment is improperly handling or processing data, likely due to a misconfiguration or bug in the system that is causing it to treat a string as a dictionary or object with a 'get' method. This prevents the agent from executing the necessary actions to transition the supply order through its required statuses and complete the task as outlined in the ground truth action sequence."
