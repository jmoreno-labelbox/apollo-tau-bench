This discrepancy prevents the agent from performing any actions related to the repository, such as checking commits, issues, alerts, or creating pull requests, which are necessary for assessing compliance with the New Service Onboarding and Governance Policy. The environment's inability to locate the repository leads to repeated errors and prevents the agent from executing the required actions."
