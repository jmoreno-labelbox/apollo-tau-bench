The ground truth action sequence indicates that the agent should have executed a series of actions to ensure the repository's compliance with the onboarding and governance policy before attempting to get the repository health summary. The agent failed to perform these necessary setup actions and instead focused solely on invoking the health summary tool incorrectly."

The tool was called with the argument `repo_name`, which is not a valid argument for this tool, leading to errors. The correct action, as per the ground truth, should have been to call `GetRepositoryHealthSummary` with the correct arguments, which are not specified in the trajectory but should align with the tool's expected parameters."
