Instead, it repeatedly attempted to retrieve information from a non-existent repository, resulting in errors and failing to progress towards achieving the user's goal."

Specifically, the assistant tried to invoke `GetRepositoryHealthSummaryTool` and `GetRepositoryMetadataTool` with the argument `repo_name`, which is not expected by these tools. This led to errors and prevented the assistant from correctly verifying the repository's compliance status, which is a key part of the user instruction. In the ground truth action sequence, the correct actions involve creating and managing the repository and its components, which were not executed due to the incorrect tool usage in the trajectory."
