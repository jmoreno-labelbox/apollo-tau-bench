According to the ground truth action sequence, this label should have been applied during the creation of the new issue. Additionally, the agent did not attempt to update the labels on the new issue to include only 'bug' and 'payments' after adding the comment, as specified in the ground truth. Instead, the agent encountered errors and did not complete these label updates, which are crucial steps in the ground truth action sequence."
