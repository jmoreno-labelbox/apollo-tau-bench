            "description": "The agent is responsible for the fault because it failed to correctly add the TP-Link Kasa HS110 smart plug with the specified ID \"plug_kt_coffee\" and name \"Kitchen Coffee Maker Plug\" to the system. The agent repeatedly encountered errors indicating that the device was not recognized, which prevented it from verifying the plug's state, turning it off if necessary, and setting up the required automation. This failure to properly register and manage the device contrasts with the ground truth action sequence, where the device is successfully added, verified, and scheduled for automation."

            "description": "The trajectory contains a fault of type \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" because the assistant attempted to add the device with incorrect parameters. In the ground truth, the device is added with the ID \"plug_kt_coffee\" and the type \"outlet\", whereas in the trajectory, the assistant adds the device without specifying the correct ID and type, leading to errors and the device not being recognized in subsequent steps. This discrepancy in the device ID and type parameters is the functional difference causing the fault."
