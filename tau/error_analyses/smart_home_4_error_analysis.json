Additionally, the agent did not proceed to manage the room in the database, update the device state, or set up the scheduled updates and reminders as specified in the ground truth action sequence."

In the ground truth, the state parameters for the device \"plug_kt_coffee\" are specified as \"power\" and \"energy_kwh\". However, in the trajectory, the assistant added the device with state parameters \"power\" and \"energy consumption\", which is incorrect. The correct parameter should be \"energy_kwh\" as per the ground truth."
