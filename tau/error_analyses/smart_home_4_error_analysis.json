The agent encountered repeated errors indicating that the device was not found, despite the device being added to the system earlier in the trajectory. This indicates a failure in the agent's ability to correctly update the device's scheduled updates, which is a key part of the ground truth action sequence."

This discrepancy led to subsequent errors in the trajectory, such as the device not being found when attempting to update its scheduled state."
