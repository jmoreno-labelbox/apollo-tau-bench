Additionally, the agent did not manage to update the device with the scheduled automation to turn on at 6:45 AM daily, as specified in the user instruction."

The assistant added the device with the type \"smart_plug\" and only included the state parameter \"power\". However, the ground truth specifies that the device should be added with the type \"outlet\" and should include both \"power\" and \"energy_kwh\" as state parameters. This discrepancy in the device type and state parameters constitutes the \"used_wrong_tool_argument\" fault."
