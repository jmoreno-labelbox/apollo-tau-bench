Additionally, the agent did not attempt to execute the `ListTerminalLog` action to verify the presence of the log event. These actions are necessary to confirm the readiness of the backfill cutoff setup as per the user instruction."

In the ground truth, `RecordTerminalLog` is called with `event_type` and `message` arguments, and `ListTerminalLog` is called with the `event_type` argument. However, in the trajectory, the agent repeatedly encounters errors related to missing or incorrect arguments, such as \"BrowseTerminalLog.invoke() missing 1 required positional argument: 'event_type'\" and \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\", indicating that the correct arguments were not used."
