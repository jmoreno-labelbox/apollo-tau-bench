Additionally, the agent did not successfully retrieve the terminal log using `ListTerminalLog` to confirm the presence of the log event. Instead, the agent repeatedly encountered errors due to missing required arguments and did not address these issues, leading to the failure to confirm the readiness of the backfill cutoff as instructed."

Initially, the backfill cutoff was incorrectly set to \"2025-12-31\" instead of the correct date \"2025-12-22\" as specified in the ground truth action sequence. This discrepancy led to the need for a correction later in the trajectory."
