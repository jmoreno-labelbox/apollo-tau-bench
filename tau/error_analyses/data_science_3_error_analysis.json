The ground truth action sequence involves specific actions to update the project configuration, record and list terminal log events, and handle QC figures, none of which are executed in the trajectory. Instead, the trajectory is stuck in a loop of unsuccessful updates and retrievals, failing to establish the backfill cutoff or confirm readiness as instructed."
