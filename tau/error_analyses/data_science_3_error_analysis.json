Despite multiple attempts to set the backfill cutoff to '2025-12-22T20:00:00Z', the environment consistently returns a null value for the backfill cutoff, indicating that the update was not successful. Additionally, there are errors related to the retrieval of terminal log events and QC PDFs, suggesting issues with the environment's ability to handle these operations correctly. These failures prevent the agent from achieving the desired final conditions specified in the user instruction."
