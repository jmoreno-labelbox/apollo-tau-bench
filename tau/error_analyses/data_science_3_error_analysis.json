In the ground truth, the `UpdateProjectConfig` action is correctly invoked with the `updates` argument containing the `backfill_cutoff` key and its corresponding value. However, in the trajectory, the tool attempts to use `ModifyProjectConfig.invoke()` with incorrect arguments such as `key` and `backfill_cutoff`, leading to errors. This incorrect usage of arguments results in the failure to properly update the project configuration as intended."
