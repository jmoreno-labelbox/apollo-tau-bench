This error prevents the agent from executing the necessary actions to update the project configuration, record terminal logs, and manage QC figures as specified in the ground truth action sequence. The environment's failure to handle the '_fixed_now_iso' variable correctly disrupts the agent's ability to fulfill the user instruction."
