            "description": "The environment is responsible for the fault in the trajectory because it fails to update the project configuration with the 'backfill_cutoff' key and value. Despite multiple attempts to set the 'backfill_cutoff' to '2025-12-22T20:00:00Z', the environment consistently returns a null value, indicating that the update is not being applied. This discrepancy between the expected behavior (successful update and retrieval of the 'backfill_cutoff' value) and the actual outcome (failure to update and retrieve the value) suggests an issue with the environment's handling of configuration updates."
