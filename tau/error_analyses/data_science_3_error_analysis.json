The agent encountered repeated errors ('str' object has no attribute 'get') when attempting to confirm the presence of the log event 'BACKFILL_CUTOFF_APPLIED'. This indicates that the agent did not properly handle the logging operations, which are necessary to meet the user's instruction requirements. Additionally, the agent did not proceed to the subsequent actions related to exporting, inserting, and retrieving the QC PDF, which are part of the ground truth action sequence."

The trajectory shows repeated errors: \"Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'\", indicating that the tool was invoked incorrectly, likely with a string instead of the expected structured argument. In the ground truth, the `RecordTerminalLog` and `ListTerminalLog` actions are used with specific arguments to handle the log event, which is missing or incorrectly implemented in the trajectory."
