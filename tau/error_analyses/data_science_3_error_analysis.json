Despite multiple attempts to set the backfill cutoff to \"2025-12-22T20:00:00Z\", the value remains null, indicating that the environment does not correctly process or apply the update. This discrepancy prevents the agent from proceeding with subsequent actions, such as recording the terminal log event and handling the QC PDF, which are contingent on the successful update of the project configuration."
