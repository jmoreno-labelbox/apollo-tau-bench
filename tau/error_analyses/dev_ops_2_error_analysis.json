The errors, such as \"'str' object has no attribute 'get'\" and \"'dict' object has no attribute 'append'\", indicate that the environment is not correctly processing the agent's requests or is misconfigured, leading to failures in executing the necessary steps to handle the CI triage tasks. These errors prevent the agent from performing actions like attaching artifacts, reducing log windows, symbolication, and creating draft pull requests, which are essential parts of the ground truth action sequence."
