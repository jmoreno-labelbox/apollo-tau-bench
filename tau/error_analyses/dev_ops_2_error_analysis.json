The agent did not perform any of the required actions such as ingesting the CI webhook, validating the sender, attaching artifacts, reducing the log window, symbolizing the minidump, looking up similar incidents, enumerating suspects, launching a targeted bisect, drafting a fix diff, opening an auto branch, committing a patch, opening a draft PR, creating or updating a ticket, triggering smoke validation, recording the automation run, and returning the draft PR number. Instead, the agent repeatedly encountered errors related to incorrect data handling and failed to progress with the task."

In the ground truth action sequence, the correct tool `CreateOrUpdateTicketV2` is used with the appropriate arguments, including `project_key`, `summary`, `description`, `run_id`, and `pr_number`.
