    "For fulfilling an order containing a single item, inventory must be allocated from the warehouse possessing the greatest 'quantity_available' for the requested SKU.",
    "If several warehouses satisfy the orderâ€™s specified requirements (such as certifications), the order MUST be fulfilled from the warehouse with the largest 'quantity_available' of the requested SKU. Should no individual warehouse have the required quantity, the order cannot be fulfilled.",
    "When a single warehouse cannot supply the entire quantity for an order line, the maximum possible amount must be sourced from the warehouse with the highest inventory, with the remaining quantity fulfilled from the warehouse with the next highest inventory. This allocation process should repeat until the order is fully satisfied. Separate outbound orders must be generated for each warehouse shipment. For any outbound order marked with a 'Critical' priority, an 'Air' carrier is required. Among eligible air carriers, you MUST choose the one with the highest 'on_time_delivery_percentage'. In the event of a tie, select the carrier with the highest 'average_rating' to break the tie. When performing a stock transfer, the source warehouse MUST be the one with the greatest 'quantity_available' of the specified SKU, so as to minimize operational disruption. A carrier is deemed underperforming if their 'on_time_delivery_percentage' falls below 95%.",
    "When an order is reassigned from an underperforming carrier, the replacement carrier MUST provide the identical mode of transport and possess the highest 'on_time_delivery_percentage' among all available options.",
    "When issuing a replacement purchase order for goods damaged upon receipt from a supplier, the replacement order must be directed to the same supplier and assigned a 'High' priority designation to guarantee expedited handling.",
    "Every new Purchase Order number MUST be produced by identifying the largest existing PO number in the 'PO-YYYY-XXXX' format for the current year and increasing the sequential portion ('XXXX') by one. The year segment ('YYYY') must correspond to the year the order is created, and the sequential number resets to '0001' at the start of each new year.",
    "Every product that a customer returns must be sent back to the same warehouse that fulfilled the original order.",
    "For domestic returns with a total weight under 500kg, the assigned return carrier shall be 'Global Parcel Service' using the 'Ground - Return Service' level.",
    "For each return that is approved, a credit memo ID must be created. The format of this ID should be 'CM-' appended to the numeric portion of the original Order ID (for example, 'CM-0001' for 'ORD-0001').",
    "For outbound orders assigned a 'High' priority, select the carrier possessing the highest 'on_time_delivery_percentage' that also accommodates the required mode of transport. In cases where multiple carriers share the top percentage, the carrier with the highest 'average_rating' must be selected to resolve the tie.",
    "Every new Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number MUST follow a sequential generation process. If there are no existing RMAs, assign 'RMA-1001' as the initial ID. Otherwise, determine the highest current RMA number formatted as 'RMA-XXXX', and create the next ID by incrementing the numeric portion ('XXXX') by one.",
    "If an action involves more than one subject, the associated ID parameter must consist of a single string where each individual ID is concatenated using a semicolon (';') as the separator, without any spaces.",
    "The assigned return carrier for every international return is 'Express World Delivery'.",
    "The carrier specified for all orders placed by customer 'Kappa Books Pvt Ltd.' is 'Pacific Ocean Lines'.",
    "For orders marked as 'Medium' or 'Low' priority, if no other rule is applicable, choose the active carrier possessing the highest 'average_rating' for the specified transport mode. In the event of a tie, select the carrier with the greatest 'on_time_delivery_percentage'.",
    "Any product classified under the 'Technology' category with a 'unit_cost' exceeding $10,000 is required to be housed in a warehouse equipped with both 'High-Value Cage' and 'UL Certified Vault' features.",
    "The 'update_inventory_damage_status' tool must be utilized with a negative value for 'damaged_quantity' in order to return undamaged items to available inventory, signifying either a reversal of previously recorded damage or a positive restocking.",
    "For every order placed by the customer 'Epsilon Fashion Co.', the revenue recognized per unit of 'Organic Cotton T-Shirt' is set at $25.00 USD. When evaluating carrier profitability, if two carriers yield the same profit, preference must be given to the carrier with the greater 'on_time_delivery_percentage'. Should this also result in a tie, the carrier with the higher 'average_rating' must be selected.",
    "Shipments sent by 'Sea' to Korea are required to utilize the specified carrier 'Pacific Ocean Lines'.",
    "Every new Sales Order number must follow the format 'SO-YYYY-XXXX', with 'YYYY' representing the current year and the sequential 'XXXX' matching the number from its associated Order ID (ORD-XXXX).",
