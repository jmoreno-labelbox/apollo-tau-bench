    "All management of customer records, accounts, transactions, loans, scheduled payments, support tickets, and beneficiaries must be performed solely through the designated APIs.",
    "Customers are permitted to access or update only their personal data; each API request must confirm that the provided customer_id corresponds to the customer performing the action.",
    "Perform actions in sequence, making sure to utilize the outcome of each preceding action before proceeding to the following one. All existing IDs within the loaded datasets must remain unchanged from their original values.",
    "Every new Customer ID is generated as `cust_<n>` using get_next_customer_id(). The get_next_customer_id() function increments the value of n by 1 prior to returning the customer id, ensuring uniqueness.",
    "Each new Account ID is assigned in the format `acc_<n>` through get_next_account_id(). The get_next_account_id() method increases n by 1 before issuing the account id, preventing any conflicts.",
    "For every new Beneficiary ID, the format `bene_<n>` is used, generated by get_next_beneficiary_id(). The get_next_beneficiary_id() function increments n by 1 before returning the beneficiary id, thereby avoiding conflicts.",
    "Every new Loan application ID is generated as `app_<n>`, and each loan ID as `loan_<n>`, using get_next_loan_application_id() and get_next_loan_id(), respectively. Both get_next_loan_application_id() and get_next_loan_id() increment the value of n by 1 prior to returning the application ID or loan ID, ensuring uniqueness.",
    "Each newly created Scheduled payment ID follows the format `sp_<n>` and is produced by get_next_payment_id(), while support ticket IDs follow `tkt_<n>` and are generated by get_next_support_ticket_id(). Both get_next_payment_id() and get_next_support_ticket_id() increment n by 1 before returning the payment ID or support ticket ID, preventing any conflicts.",
    "All new Transaction IDs are formatted as `txn_<n>` and are generated through get_next_transaction_id(). The get_next_transaction_id() function increments n by 1 before returning the transaction ID, guaranteeing there are no conflicts.",
    "The value of <n> is unique to each entity; for instance, increasing cust_3 does not affect acc_1. When generating monthly schedules, consistently add N months to the start date (for example, one month after 2025‑08‑24 becomes 2025‑09‑24), ensuring the day component remains unchanged instead of applying a fixed-day interval.",
    "The loan decision time must always occur after the loan application time.",
    "If the user instruction does not specify a current timestamp, use 2025-07-31T12:00:00Z as the default value.",
    "Prior to processing any debit (including transfer, withdrawal, or scheduled payment), verify that `account.balance >= amount`; if the balance is insufficient, the operation will be paused or denied by the tools.",
    "For transfers involving the same currency, ensure both accounts have matching currencies; utilize transfer_money_same_currency().",
    "For transfers between different currencies, obtain the rate using get_currency_conversion_amount(), then proceed with transfer_money_with_conversion().",
    "If the balance allows, scheduled payments are deducted instantly; the status is determined by create_new_schedule_payment().",
    "Customers are permitted to transfer funds solely in the source account’s currency; to transfer in another currency, they must use pay_to_beneficiary_with_conversion() or transfer_money_with_conversion().",
    "Incoming payments must match the account’s currency; any discrepancy in currency will trigger an error. Interest Rates for Loan Types are as follows: 'Auto' = 10.0%, 'Home' = 12.0%, 'Student' = 8.0%, 'Business' = 9.0%, 'Personal' = 15.0%, and 18% for any other type. These rates are assigned during loan application processing. By default, support tickets have `priority` set to Medium and `channel` set to Web Portal unless explicitly specified otherwise.",
    "Support tickets where the 'cateory' field is assigned 'Fraud', 'Card Lost', or 'Security' will have their 'Priority' set to 'High'.",
    "Any modification to customer personal or contact information will be treated as a Profile Update.",
    "By default, new loan applications will have the status 'Submitted'. While the Loan application is being processed, its status will be 'Under Review'. Once processing is complete, the status will be updated to either 'Approved' or 'Rejected', depending on the decision.",
    "To modify any customer personal or contact information, first execute add_support_ticket_for_customer_id(), then proceed with the relevant update API (such as update_email_for_of_customer_id()), and finally close the ticket using change_support_ticket_status().",
    "When a customer updates their phone number, they must specify whether it should be set as primary; if this is not indicated, the number will not be set as primary. Updating a customer’s address will automatically designate it as primary. To create a customer, use add_new_customer(); retrieve the customer using either get_customer_details_by_name() or get_customer_details_by_customer_id().",
    "For account creation: first resolve the account type code via get_account_type_and_account_type_code(), then invoke create_new_account_for_customer(). The 'account_number_last_4' is generated randomly, with the random seed set to 42.",
    "Retrieve details for an existing account by using either get_account_details_by_customer_id_and_account_id() or get_customer_account_details_by_customer_id_and_account_type(). To obtain information on all accounts belonging to a customer, use get_all_accounts_of_customer_by_customer_id(). For scheduling or canceling payments, utilize create_new_schedule_payment() or cancel_payment_by_scheduled_payment_id().",
    "For beneficiary management: add a beneficiary using add_new_beneficiary_for_customer(), list beneficiaries with get_all_beneficiaries_for_customer_id(), and retrieve beneficiary details with get_beneficiary_details_for_customer_id_and_beneficiary_name().",
    "When making a payment to a beneficiary in the same currency, apply pay_to_beneficiary_same_currency().",
    "When paying a beneficiary in a currency other than their default, invoke pay_to_beneficiary_with_conversion().",
    "For support ticket management: create tickets using add_support_ticket_for_customer_id(), update their status via change_support_ticket_status(), and list them with get_support_ticket_information_by_customer_id().",
    "Task action parameters should originate from either the user instruction or obtained data; do not generate or assume values not explicitly provided in the instruction.",
    "When the start date and end date of a scheduled payment are identical, the payment is processed immediately; if the date specified is in the future, the payment is set to execute on that future date. To retrieve transactions for a scheduled payment, use get_payment_id_by_customer_id_and_beneficiary_id(). To verify that an account holds a balance greater than the requested amount, use check_account_balance(). To determine the total balance across all accounts for a given customer id, use calculate_total_balance(). All API responses are returned as JSON objects; if an error occurs, an `error` field must be included to describe any missing or invalid parameters.",
    "Do not perform more than one API call per user request unless a multi-step workflow is specifically orchestrated.",
    "Under no circumstances should data be returned or altered for any customer other than the one specified by the `customer_id` parameter.",
    "All tools utilize the actual system date/time at the moment of execution, unless this behavior is specifically overridden.",
