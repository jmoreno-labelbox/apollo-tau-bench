ENVIRONMENT CONVERSION STATUS
=============================

✅ WORKING: 115/122 (94.3%)

❌ REMAINING 7 FAILURES:

1. airline/variation_5 - 4 validation errors (likely dict values in outputs)
2. banking_services/variation_2 - instruction is tuple instead of string
3. career_planner/variation_4 - Extra fields in Task (not just annotator)
4. career_planner/variation_5 - Extra fields in Task (not just annotator)
5. consulting_accounting/variation_5 - validation error in outputs
6. file_system/variation_1 - instruction is tuple
7. rbac/variation_4 - Extra fields in Task (not just annotator)

These 7 need manual inspection/editing as they have structural issues
beyond simple field conversion.

WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED:
- Created 122 env.py files
- Fixed 120 tools/__init__.py imports
- Converted outputs format in 115 environments
- Renamed sports-analytics → sports_analytics
- 94.3% success rate!
